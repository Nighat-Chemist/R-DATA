TI  - FeS2 Nanoparticles Embedded in Reduced Graphene Oxide toward Robust, High-Performance Electrocatalysts
T2  - ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing low-cost, highly efficient, and robust earth-abundant electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is critical for the scalable production of clean and sustainable hydrogen fuel through electrochemical water splitting. This study presents a facile approach for the synthesis of nanostructured pyrite-phase transition metal dichalcogenides as highly active, earthabundant catalysts in electrochemical hydrogen production. Iron disulfide (FeS2) nanoparticles are in situ loaded and stabilized on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) through a current-induced high-temperature rapid thermal shock (approximate to 12 ms) of crushed iron pyrite powder. FeS2 nanoparticles embedded in between RGO exhibit remarkably improved electrocatalytic performance for HER, achieving 10 mA cm(-2) current at an overpotential as low as 139 mV versus a reversible hydrogen electrode with outstanding long-term stability under acidic conditions. The presented strategy for the design and synthesis of highly active earth-abundant nanomaterial catalysts paves the way for lowcost and large-scale electrochemical energy applications.

TI  - Tungsten-molybdenum oxide nanowires/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite with enhanced and durable performance for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrogen has attracted huge interest globally as a durable, environmentally safe and renewable fuel. Electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is one of the most promising methods for large scale hydrogen production, but the high cost of Pt-based materials which exhibit the highest activity for HER forced researchers to find alternative electro-catalyst. In this study, we report noble metal free a 3D hybrid composite of tungsten-molybdenum oxide and reduced graphene oxide (GO) prepared by a simple one step hydrothermal method for HER. Benefiting from the synergistic effect between tungsten-molybdenum oxide nanowires and reduced graphene oxide, the obtained W-Mo-O/rGO nanocomposite showed excellent electro-catalytic activity for HER with onset potential 50 mV, a Tafel slope of 46 mV decade(-1) and a large cathodic current, while the tungsten-molybdenum oxide nanowires itself is not as efficient HER catalyst. Additionally, W-Mo-O/rGO composite also demonstrated good durability up to 2000 cycles in acidic medium. The enhanced and durable hydrogen evolution reaction activity stemmed from the synergistic effect broadens noble metal free catalysts for HER and provides an insight into the design and synthesis of low-cost and environment friendly catalysts in electrochemical hydrogen production.

TI  - (0D/3D) MoS2 on porous graphene as catalysts for enhanced electrochemical hydrogen evolution
T2  - CARBON
M3  - Article
AB  - A new composite material consisting of 0D MoS2 nanodots and 3D MoS2 nano-flowers grown on porous reduced graphene oxide (P-rGO) was synthesized via a two-step process. The P-rGO with a surface area of 759 m(2) g(-1) was obtained by CO2 activation of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) at 800 degrees C. MoS2 was then grown on the P-rGO under hydrothermal conditions. Compared to the nonactivated rGO, P-rGO has functional pores for deposition of MoS2 nanodots and less charge transfer resistance, which can provide more active sites for hydrogen generation, thus leading to the improved activity of (0D/3D) MoS2/P-rGO in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The overpotential of (0D/3D) MoS2/P-rGO was only similar to 150 mV vs. RHE, and the corresponding Tafel slope was similar to 56 mV Dec(-1), which is comparable to most of the present MoS2/Graphene HER catalysts. The (0D/3D) MoS2/P-rGO exhibits as an efficient noble metal free HER catalyst, and has great potential for the electrochemical hydrogen production. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Development of advanced hydrogen storage materials with high capacity and stability is vital to achieve an envisaged hydrogen economy. Here, we report a uniformly dispersed Pd nanoparticles on the boron-doped reduced graphene oxide (Pd/B-rGO) as a novel nanocomposite for efficient hydrogen storage. The effects of the incorporation of Pd NPs and the substitution of boron atoms into the graphene-based nanomaterial matrix on the electrochemical hydrogen up-taking and releasing were comparatively studied using electrochemical techniques, and duly supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The discharge capacities of the Pd-rGO and Pd/B-rGO nanocomposites were determined to be over 45 and 128 times higher than that of the Pd NPs, respectively, showing that the B doping and the rGO support played significant roles in the enhancement of the hydrogen storage capability. Moreover, the galvanostatic charging and discharging cycling tests demonstrated a high stability and efficient kinetics of the Pd/B-rGO nanocomposite in the H2SO4 electrolyte for hydrogen up-taking and release.

TI  - Comparison of magnetite/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites and magnetite nanoparticles on enhancing hydrogen production in dark fermentation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Magnetite/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites (Fe3O4-rGO NCs) and magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs) were added to enhance biohydrogen (bioH(2)) production in dark fermentation. Concentration of supplements from 10 to 100 mg/L was appropriate to enhance bioH(2) production, and inhibition appeared once concentration exceeded 100 mg/L. The best bioH(2) yield was 198.30 mL/g glucose at 100 mg/L Fe3O4 NPs and 225.60 mL/g glucose at 100 mg/L Fe3O4-rGO NCs, which was 42.97% and 62.65% higher than that in the blank group, respectively. Both Fe3O4 NPs and Fe3O4-rGO NCs could intensify butyrate-type fermentation and change the hydrogen-producing microorganism cells morphology, but the enhancement effect of Fe3O4-rGO NCs was superior. Microbial community structure analysis showed that Clostridium-sensu-stricto-1 became more dominant ultimately by Fe3O4-rGO NCs. (C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Embedded cobalt sulfide/N-doped reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite for high-efficiency hydrogen evolution catalysis
T2  - MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The construction of a less expensive and highly effective electrocatalyst for using in electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) play a decisive role in terms of renewable hydrogen energy. Among them, transition metal compounds are the indispensable part for the development of electrocatalysts, which has important importance that cannot be ignored. Here, the cobalt sulfide monomer were separately embedded in the surface and intermediate layer of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-RGO) by a novel and simple method. The presence of CoS nanoparticles hindered redeposition of the N-RGO layer and increases the space between the layers, which effectively improved the electrochemical performance of the catalysts. Excellent electrochemical performance is shown as a low onset potential of -50.3 mV, a low Tafel slope of 74.4 mV/dec, and a high double layer capacitance of 9.8 mF cm(-2), which is superior to most CoS catalysts. In addition, CoS/N-RGO nanocomposites have good stability under acidic conditions. The novel and simple preparation method provides a reference for the preparation of low-cost electrocatalysts having excellent HER properties.

TI  - H-2 production from the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of methylamine-borane catalyzed by sulfonated reduced graphene oxide-aided synthesis of ruthenium nanoparticles
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A new catalyst was prepared using sulfonated reduced graphene oxide support with a large surface area containing ruthenium nanoparticles (Ru@rGO-SO3H). The developed Ru@rGO-SO3H catalyst was used in the hydrogen production process from the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of methylamine-borane (MeAB). Sulfonated reduced graphene oxide and the developed catalyst were characterized by Raman and FT-IR spectroscopies, ICP-OES, XRD, XPS, TEM, TEM-EDX, SEM and SEM-EDX techniques. The average particle size of Ru nano particles, which were homogeneously distributed on the sulfonated reduced graphene oxide surface, was found as 2.2 +/- 0.2 nm. After analyzing the effect of nanocatalyst and substrate concentrations on the catalytic reaction, reactions were realized at different temperatures, the efficiency of the Ru@rGO-SO3H nanocatalyst in initial turnover frequency (TOFinitial) and the activation parameters (E-a, Delta H-# and Delta S-#) were calculated. According to the data obtained, the TOFinitial value was calculated as 5300.86 h(-1) (88.35 min(-1)). E-a, Delta H-# and Delta S-# values were also calculated as 53.83 kJ/mol, 50.73 kJ/mol and -51.55 J/mol.K, respectively. Finally, when the reusability performance results of the catalyst are evaluated, it is found that the catalyst is very stable and retains its initial effectiveness to a great extent (>95%) after the 5th reuse.

TI  - Enhanced photocatalytic activity and stability of the reduced graphene oxide loaded potassium niobate microspheres for hydrogen production from water reduction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A facile approach to synthesize reduced graphene oxide (RGO) loaded potassium niobate microspheres was reported. The composition, microstructure and electron-transfer properties of the obtained product were characterized. Compared to pure potassium niobate microspheres and commercial P25 TiO2, the as-prepared potassium niobate microspheres/RGO composite showed much higher photocatalytic activity for generating hydrogen under UV irradiation. It was ascribed to the enhanced separation efficiency of electron/hole pairs as testified by electrochemical impedance spectrum and fluorescence spectrum. Importantly, the composite photocatalyst was stable and easy to recycle, and the amount of hydrogen evolution did not decrease after six recycles. The results are potentially applicable to a range of semiconductors useful in water reduction as well as other areas of heterogeneous photocatalysis.

TI  - Magnetic CoOx@C-Reduced graphene oxide composite with catalytic activity towards hydrogen generation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cobalt-containing magnetic core-shell structures are alternative catalysts with better catalytic performance for hydrogen evolution. In this study, a facile route is adopted to fabricate a CoOx@carbon-reduced graphene oxide composite containing Co nanoparticle cores, carbon shells, and reduced graphene oxide. During hydrogen generation through the catalytic hydrolysis of NaBH4 and NH3BH3, the surface of CoOx cores provides active catalytic sites, and the carbon shells protect the CoOx cores from aggregating into gigantic cobalt oxide granules. The magnetism of CoOx anchored onto reduced graphene oxide sheets achieves effectively a momentum transfer assisted by a motional external magnetic field. In a batch reactor, the composite exhibits a higher catalytic activity in a self-stirring mode than that in a magneton-stirring mode. This simple and efficient synthesis strategy is highly promising for the next development of both facile hydrogen generation and core-shell composite functional materials.

TI  - Mo-doped ZnV2O6/reduced graphene oxide photoanodes for solar hydrogen production

M3  - Article
AB  - We report the fabrication and characterization of molybdenum (Mo)-doped ZnV2O6/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composite and its use as photoanode for photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen production. Compared to pure ZnV2O6, Mo ions act as electron donor in the ZnV2O6:Mo lattice increasing charge carrier concentration and subsequently mobility in the bulk by the polaron transport. We measured the hole transfer efficiency for the pure and Mo-doped ZnV2O6 electrodes and revealing a substantial increase from 16 to 25%. The mechanism of enhanced photoactivity of Mo-doped ZnV2O6 was studied by density functional theory calculations. Moreover, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements show that graphene modification improves carrier separation and transfer across the electrode/electrolyte interface. Therefore, the combination of the two strategies triggers a synergistic enhancement in PEC performance in terms of incident photon-to-current efficiency, which is 17% at 370 nm, being 4.5- and 3.6-times greater than those of pristine ZnV2O6 and ZnV2O6:Mo photoanodes, respectively. With photocurrent onset potentials of 0.6 V and photocurrent densities of 2.07 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE, ZnV2O6:Mo/rGO photoanodes are of interest for the design of high performance PEC visible-light-induced water-splitting devices.

TI  - Comparison study of electrocatalytic activity of reduced graphene oxide supported Pt-Cu bimetallic or Pt nanoparticles for the electrooxidation of methanol and ethanol
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Pt-Cu bimetallic nanoparticles supported on reduced graphene oxide (Pt-Cu/RGO) were synthesized through the simple one-step reduction of H2PtCl6 and CuSO4 in the presence of graphene oxide (GO) at room-temperature. The Pt-Cu/RGO was characterized with UV-vis spectrophotometer, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and its catalytic behavior for the direct oxidation of methanol was investigated. Compared to Pt/RGO and Pt/C catalysts, Pt-Cu/RGO hybrids exhibited markedly superior catalytic activity for the electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol and ethanol. This improved catalytic activity can be attributed to the dendritic structure of the Pt-Cu bimetallic nanoparticles. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Flexible and lightweight reduced graphene oxide wrapped Si/carbon fibers paper (Si@RGO/CFP) anodes have been prepared by pyrolysis of the common filter paper, which was soaked into the suspension containing graphene oxide and Si. The reduced graphene oxide wrapped Si nanoparticles (Si@RGO) homogeneously distributed on the interlaced carbon fibers and void among the carbon fibers. The Si@RGO/CFP as a flexible binder-free electrode exhibits an initial reversible capacity of 2055 mAh g(-1) and 1092 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles for Si@RGO at 100 mA g(-1) along with good rate performance. The superior electrochemical performance of the Si@RGO/CFP is attributed to the interconnected carbon fibers substrate, which provides electronic conduction pathways and works as mechanical support, and the void among carbon fibers accommodates the volume changes of Si and maintains the integrity of the electrode materials.

AB  - Reduced graphene oxide (RGO)/CdxZn(1-x)S composites were firstly synthesized by thermal sulfurization method in one pot with elemental sulfur as sulfur source. By using one pot synthesis, CdxZn(1-x)S particles were decorated on the RGO sheets during sulfurization of Cd2+ and Zn2+ precursors. This synthesis method eased the control of the particle sizes of CdxZn(1-x)S by providing homogenous decoration of RGO with CdxZn(1-x)S particles and increased the strength between RGO sheet and CdxZn(1-x)S particles, which enhanced charge carrier mobility rate. Here, RGO in the composite structure supplied high electron conductivity, high adsorption capacity and extended light absorption ability. Thus, prepared RGO/CdxZn(1-x)S composites enhanced the photocatalytic activity. The crystal systems, lattice parameters, band gaps and surface morphologies of all photocatalysts are characterized to determine the factors that affected the photocatalytic activities of the composites. After that, the photocatalytic activities of prepared photocatalysts were tested by measuring H-2 evolution rates. Among the composites, RGO/Cd0.7Zn0.3S structure possessed the highest H-2 production rate (141.6 mu molh(-1)) and apparent quantum efficiency (19.4%). (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB  - In present study, we report a facile synthesis of crystalline, small size Pd nanoparticles (NPs) on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) abbreviated as Pd/RGO for electrocatalytic oxidation of formic acid (FA). Here, first graphene oxide (GO) was reduced by the green method using l-ascorbic acid and citric acid and further Pd NPs were decorated on RGO by a facile method without using any reducing agents. The reduction of GO to RGO and synthesis of Pd NPs was confirmed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectrons (XPS) techniques. Surface morphology of Pd/RGO nanocomposite was evaluated by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. The electrocatalytic behavior of Pd/RGO nanocomposite was tested by using of cyclic voltammetric (CV) technique for electro-oxidation of FA in mixed solution of 0.5 M HCOOH + 0.5 H2SO4 at RT. Results shows that the higher electrocatalytic activity of Pd/RGO nano composite compare to Pd NPs. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Visible light responsive noble metal-free nanocomposite of V-doped TiO2 nanorod with highly reduced graphene oxide for enhanced solar H-2 production
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The visible light responsive nanocomposite of vanadium-doped TiO2 nanorod anchoring on highly reduced graphene oxide (RGO) has been successfully synthesized using a simple one step low temperature hydrothermal method. The nanoparticles, loaded on RGO, were intentionally fabricated as nanorods to enhance their contact with the RGO sheets. Compared to undoped TiO2 and non-composited V-TiO2 nanoparticles, the nanocomposite exhibited enhanced H-2 evolution under visible light illumination. Density Functional Theory (DFT) computation also confirms the bandgap narrowing of TiO2 by doping vanadium. Furthermore, the photogenerated electrons could be effectively trapped by the conducting RGO sheets, thereby suppressing electron hole recombination. This noble metal-free nanocomposite material composed of highly conducting sheets also offers promise for other energy applications such as lithium ion batteries.

AB  - Molybdenum dioxide nanoparticles embedded porous reduced graphene oxide (MoO2-pGR) were prepared for catalyzing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by a simple pyrolysis method. The as-prepared product was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The HER electrocatalytic property of MoO2-pGR in acidic solution was evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). As expected, MoO2-pGR composites exhibit a high HER active with a low Tafel slope of 57.8 mV dec(-1), a small onset potential (E-onset) of -72.53 mV US. RHE and an outstanding long-term stability. These results provide a new thought for the synthesis of MoO2-pGR composites as an excellent HER catalysts. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Near-infrared responsive reduced graphene oxide supported CuS: Enhanced electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Various reduced graphene oxide supported CuS (RGO-CuS) composites were obtained via a hydrothermal way in this work. The as-obtained RGO-CuS with a low bandgap of-1.24 eV showed significant light absorption in near-infrared (NIR) region. In acidic media, the optimized 0.1RGO-CuS needed an overpotential of 179 mV (at 10 mA cm(-2)) to trigger the hydrogen evolution reaction under NIR light. And the lowest Tafel slope of 0.1RGO-CuS (61 mV dec(-1)), suggesting that the photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen evolution was performed under the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. The 0.1RGO-CuS displayed a good durability after 5000 cycles in acid. According to the results of EIS measurement, both NIR irradiation and RGO modification could effectively lower charge transfer resistance and improve charge transport rate of the photoelectrochemical process. The introduction of RGO could improve the electron and hole separation ability of the photoelectrochemical process, which resulted in an enhanced photoelectrocatalytic HER performance.

AB  - In this paper, a simple, fast, and green method is developed for preparation of uniform Pd nanodendrites anchored on reduced graphene oxide (Pd/RGO) at room temperature, with the assistance of octylphenoxypolye thoxyethanol (NP-40) as a soft template, while no seed, organic solvent, or special apparatus involved. The as-prepared nanocomposites show the improved CO tolerance, enhanced catalytic activity, and better stability for ethylene glycol (EG) and glycerol (Gly) electrooxidation in alkaline media, compared with commercial Pd black and Pd/C catalysts.

TI  - Graphene for hydrogen energy storage - A comparative study on GO and rGO employed in a modified reversible PEM fuel cell
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We present an experimental investigation on graphene for electrochemical hydrogen storage when employed in a modified reversible polymer electrolyte membrane (MRPEM) fuel cell. Synthesis of graphene nanomaterial is performed to obtain graphene oxide (GO) using the modified Hummers method. Oxides in GO are reduced to get reduced graphene oxide (rGO) using Cedrus deodara (CD) tree's leaf extract. Physical characterisation of the prepared GO and CD-rGO is done to ascertain their properties, viz, internal pore surface area, average pore diameter, etc. Solid electrodes are fabricated from the prepared powdered samples of GO and CD-rGO, and later tested in an MRPEM fuel cell. Electrochemical hydrogen storage capacity of GO and CD-rGO is found to be 1.21 and 2.7 wt%, respectively. It is successfully demonstrated that hydrogen ions could be stored in a porous graphene electrode and recovered back. The obtained results are analysed to draw a relation between physical characteristics of graphene and electrochemical hydrogen adsorption. It is found that higher internal pore surface area attracts more hydrogen storage in ionic form. This research work is a maiden attempt to show, experimentally, the physical/chemical adsorption of hydrogen in graphene when employed in a reversible PEM fuel cell. This surely could contribute towards the development of a safe and efficient alternate powering source with many potential applications.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Platinum Iron nanoparticles supported on reduced graphene oxide powder are synthesized by chemical reduction method as an anode catalyst for the methanol electro oxidation. The characterization of the catalyst has been investigated using physical and electrochemical methods. Prepared catalyst was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), TEM (Transmission electron microscopy), FT-IR (Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy), Raman spectroscopy and, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive analysis of X-ray (EDX). Pt and Pt-Fe nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) powder nanocomposite support. The catalytic properties of the catalyst for methanol electro-oxidation were thoroughly studied by electrochemical methods that involved in the cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), chronoamperometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The Pt-Fe/rGo exhibits high electrocatalytic activity, catalyst tolerance for the CO poisoning and catalyst durability for electro-oxidation of methanol compared to the Pt/rGo and commercial Pt/C catalyst. Therefore, the Pt-Fe/rGo catalyst is a good choice for application in direct methanol fuel cells. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Monolayer Pd on electrochemical-reduced graphene oxide supported Au nanoparticles (m-Pd-Au/ERG) was designed by a simple and effective route, which produces electrocatalyst with a considerably low Pd loading and good electrocatalytic performance for ethanol oxidation. The as-prepared m-Pd-Au/ERG nanocompostie was characterized by scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The results show that high-density m-Pd-Au nanoparticles are dispersed on the surface of ERG uniformly. The electrochemical activities of the as-prepared nanocomposites toward ethanol oxidation in alkaline media were investigated by using cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometric technique. The results demonstrate that the m-Pd-Au/ERG catalyst shows much higher electrocatalytic activity, stronger tolerance to CO than the m-Pd-Au and b-Pd-Au/ERG catalysts for ethanol oxidation.

TI  - Reduced graphene oxide as an efficient support for CdS-MoS2 heterostructures for enhanced photocatalytic H-2 evolution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cadmium sulphide nanorods-reduced graphene oxide-molybdenum sulphide(CdS-rGOMoS(2)) composites were successfully synthesized using hydrothermal process for enhancing the interfacial contact between CdS nanorods and MoS2 layer. The good contact between CdS and MoS2 is important for improving the photocatalytic hydrogen (H-2) evolution. The morphological and structural studies showed the production of highly pure CdS phase with nanorod-like structure dispersed on rGO-MoS2 layer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman results confirmed the reduction of graphene oxide (GO) into reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The higher photocurrent density of CdS-rGO-MoS2 composites compared to CdS/MoS2 and the fluorescence quenching observed for this composite provided some evidence for an inhibition of electron-hole recombination, which leads to a longer life time of the photogenerated carriers. Fast electron transfer can occur from CdS nanorods by the bidimensionnel rGO area to MoS2 layer due to the intimate interfacial contact. Composite CdS-rGO-MoS2 with 20 wt% rGO was found to be the most effective photocatalyst for H-2 evolution (7.1 mmol h(-1)g(-1)). The good photocatalytic performance arose from the positive synergistic effect between CdS, rGO and MoS2 elements. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Fabrication of Pt-CeO2 nanoparticles supported sulfonated reduced graphene oxide as an efficient electrocatalyst for ethanol oxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We synthesized graphene oxide (GO) using the electrochemical exfoliation of graphite rod and then fabricated sulfonated reduced graphene oxide (SRGO) using lyophilization-assisted technique from a liquid mixture of GO and (NH4)(2)SO4 with a subsequent thermal treatment in N-2 saturated. Pt and CeO2 nanoparticles can be anchored on the oxygenated functional groups of SRGO sheets. The as-prepared SRGO, CeO2/SRGO, Pt/SRGO, and PtCeO2/SRGO nanocomposites have been carefully characterized by spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques. FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of a sulfonic acid group. X-ray diffractometer and tunneling electron microscopy techniques are employed to study the crystallite size. The ionic resistance of Pt/SRGO without Nafion solution in catalyst layer was equal to the Pt/RGO and Nafion solution but the catalytic activities of the PtCeO2/SRGO are higher than Pt/RGO with Nafion and Pt/SRGO electrodes for ethanol oxidation. Furthermore, the activation energy of the Pt-CeO2/SRGO anode was much lower than that of the Pt/RGO with Nafion and Pt/SRGO, which can reveal the particular properties of the exfoliated SRGO supports and PtCeO2.

TI  - Reduced Graphene Oxide/InGaZn Mixed Oxide Nanocomposite Photocatalysts for Hydrogen Production
T2  - CHEMSUSCHEM
M3  - Article
AB  - A series of reduced graphene oxide and indium-gallium-zinc mixed oxide (RGO/IGZ) nanocomposites were successfully synthesised by a simple one-step hydrothermal method. The as-synthesised nanocomposites were characterised by crystallographic, microscopic, and spectroscopic methods to explore the robust photocatalytic activity of the prepared materials. XRD patterns confirmed the formation of highly pure, single-phase, hexagonal In2Ga2ZnO7 with no impurity-related peaks. All the photocatalysts absorbed visible light as observed from the diffuse reflectance UV/Vis spectra. The electron-hole recombination is effectively minimised by the formation of an RGO/metal oxide nanocomposite, which was successfully derived from a photoluminescence (PL) study and photoelectrochemical measurements. The decoration of IGZ nanocrystals onto reduced graphene sheets leads to significant quenching of its luminescent intensity, dramatically improved photocurrent generation (33 times more than neat IGZ) and significantly enhanced photostability. The high photocatalytic activity for H-2 production is explained by the strong interaction between the IGZ nanocrystals with RGO sheets, low PL intensity, high photocurrent and large surface area.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Addressed herein, a novel composite material is formed between polyaniline and a reduced graphene oxide synthesized by in situ technique in a single step in order to support the platinum nanoparticles. The surface of the reduced graphene oxide layers appeared effectively and stabilized the metal nanoparticles dimensionally. Platinum@reduced graphene oxide-polyaniline (Pt@rGO-PANI) nanoparticles have been characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. All the results show that Pt rGO-PANI nanocomposite displayed excellent durability and catalytic activity for the alcohol oxidation reaction. Moreover, the resulting nanocomposite can be used in a variety of carbon-polymer applications, which can be improved and this study provides a powerful and universal synthetic strategy for new polymer-carbon composites in the literature. The methanol oxidation reactions current can reach to 47.2 mA and can maintain 68.4% of the initial value even after 100 cycles. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Synthesis of reduced graphene oxide-TiO2 nanoparticle composite systems and its application in hydrogen production
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The utilization of solar energy for the conversion of water to hydrogen and oxygen has been considered to be an efficient strategy to solve crisis of energy and environment. Here, we report the synthesis of reduced graphene oxide-TiO2 nanoparticle composite system through the photocatalytic reduction of graphite oxide using TiO2 nanoparticles. Photoelectrochemical characterizations and hydrogen evolution measurements of these nanocomposites reveal that the presence of graphene enhances the photocurrent density and hydrogen generation rate. The optimum photocurrent density and hydrogen generation rate has been found to be 3.4 mA cm(-2) and 127.5 mu mole cm(-2)h(-1) in 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution under 1.5AM solar irradiance of white light with illumination intensity of 100 mW cm(-2). In graphene TiO2 nanocomposite, photogenerated electrons in TiO2 are scavenged by graphene sheets and percolate to counter electrode to reduce H+ to molecular hydrogen thus increasing the performance of water-splitting reaction.

TI  - Monodisperse MPd (M: Co, Ni, Cu) alloy nanoparticles supported on reduced graphene oxide as cathode catalysts for the lithium-air battery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Addressed herein is the electrocatalyst performance of the monodisperse MPd (M: Co, Ni, Cu) alloy nanoparticles (NPs) supported on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) for the non-aqueous Li-air battery. MPd alloy NPs were prepared by using a well-established surfactant-assisted organic solution phase protocol comprising the co-reduction of palladium(II) acetylacetonate and M(acetate)(2) or M(acetylacetonate)(2) by borane-based mild reducing agents in oleylamine. As-synthesized Co3Pd7, Ni3Pd7 and CuPd NPs have uniform particle size distribution with the average particle size of 3.5, 3.4 and 3.0 nm, respectively. The colloidal MPd NPs were then supported on rGO before their use as cathode catalysts in the non-aqueous Li-air battery. The charge discharge curves of Li-air electrodes using rGO-CuPd, rGO-Co3Pd7 and rGO-Ni3Pd7 catalysts were investigated at a current rate of 100 mA g(-1). The specific discharge capacities were found as 4407 mA h g(-1) for rGO-CuPd, 3158 mA h g(-1) for rGO-Co3Pd7 and 2512 mA h g(-1) for rGO-Ni3Pd7. Ex-situ FTIR analyses after the 10 cycle recyclability test revealed that Li2O2 is the main component of the discharge products. The lifetime of the cathode electrodes during the first 10 cycles was found to be 100 h for rGO-Co3Pd7, 130 h for rGO-CuPd and 180 h for rGO-Ni3Pd7. The Ni3Pd7 has the highest total capacity of 8175 mA h g(-1), over the first 10 cycles. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Potential electrochemical hydrogen storage in nickel and cobalt nanoparticles-induced zirconia-graphene nanocomposite
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Green fuels which are sustainable in nature are becoming a reliable energy source in the era of climatic concerns. Hydrogen, a renewable clean energy carrier supplies energy three times more than that of conventional energy sources. Thus, efficient methods are developed to store hydrogen in a safe and cost-effective way. Synthesis of economical and environmental friendly nanomaterials that can be used for hydrogen storage has paramount importance in research field. Nanocomposites with good surface area and porosity emerge as effective materials in the field of sustainable hydrogen storage. We synthesized nanocomposites having metal, metal oxide and carbon content in them to explore their hydrogen storage capacity (HSC). Nickel zirconia reduced graphene oxide (Ni-ZrO2-rGO), and cobalt zirconia-reduced graphene oxide (Co-ZrO2-rGO) were synthesized hydrothermally. The confirmation of their structure, composition, and morphology were done by various characterizations. The surface area calculations of nanocomposites were carried out by nitrogen (N-2) adsorption-desorption measurements. Thereafter, these samples were coated onto nickel foam and their electrochemical studies were carried out in 6 M KOH electrolyte to evaluate their HSC. The discharge capacity for Ni-ZrO2-rGO was calculated to be 416.12 mAhg(-1)(1.54 wt%) and 291.38 mAhg(-1)(1.07 wt%) for Co-ZrO2-rGO. These nanocomposite having all three metal, ceramic and carbon components influence HSC in a considerable way. All constituents have significant influence, as the metal part alters the electrocatalytic properties, zirconia impacts the crystalline structure and porosity is varied due to properties of graphene.

TI  - Hierarchical reduced graphene oxide supported dealloyed platinum-copper nanoparticles for highly efficient methanol electrooxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploiting highly efficient electrocatalysts through simple methods is very critical to the development of energy conversion technologies. Herein, we develop a hierarchical reduced graphene oxide supported dealloyed platinum copper nanoparticle catalyst (Pt-Cu/RGO) by a facile one-step electrodeposition of graphene oxide in the presence of H2PtCl6 and copper ethylenediamine tetraacetate. The nanostructure and composition were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy. Meanwhile, the electrocatalytic performance was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry, showing that the Pt-Cu/RGO catalyst not only equips with an outstanding electrocatalytic activity for the methanol oxidation reaction (2.3 times that of commercial Pt/C catalyst), but also shows a robust durability and superior tolerance to CO poisoning. The excellent electrocatalytic performance could be attributed to the three-dimensional hierarchical structure, porous dealloyed nanoparticles and synergistic effect between each component.

TI  - Reduced graphene oxide-supported nickel oxide catalyst with improved CO tolerance for formic acid electrooxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The superior catalytic activity along with improved CO tolerance for formic acid electro-oxidation has been demonstrated on a NiO-decorated reduced graphene oxide (rGO) catalyst. The cyclic voltammetry response of rGO-NiO/Pt catalyst elucidates improved CO tolerance and follows direct oxidation pathway. It is probably due to the beneficial effect of residual oxygen groups on rGO support which is supported by FT-IR spectrum. A strong interaction of rGO support with NiO nanoparticles facilitates the removal of CO from the catalyst surface. The chronoamperometric response indicates a higher catalytic activity and stability of rGO-NiO/Pt catalyst than the NiO/Pt and unmodified Pt electrode catalyst for a prolonged time of continuous oxidation of formic acid.

TI  - Magnetite Nanorods Stabilized by Polyaniline/Reduced Graphene Oxide as a Sensing Platform for Selective and Sensitive Non-enzymatic Hydrogen Peroxide Detection
T2  - ELECTROANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, magnetite nanorods stabilized on polyaniline/reduced graphene oxide (Fe3O4@PANI/rGO) was synthesized via a wet-reflux strategy. The possible formation of Fe3O4@PANI/rGO was morphologically and structurally verified by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Furthermore, the thermal stability of Fe3O4@PANI/rGO was measured by a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA); the composite had good thermal stability owing to the ceramic nature of Fe3O4. The Fe3O4@PANI/rGO has been applied as a potential sensing platform for electrochemical detection of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). By the combined efforts of extended active surface area, active carbon support, more catalytic active sites and high electrical conductivity, the Fe3O4@PANI/rGO exhibited an improved performance toward the non-enzymatic detection of H2O2 in 0.5 M KOH with a fast response time (5 s), high sensitivity (223.7 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2)), low limit of detection (4.45 mu M) and wide linear range (100 mu M-1.5 mM). Furthermore, the fabricated sensor exhibited excellent recovery rates (94.2-104.0 %) during real sample analysis.

AB  - In this work, cobalt hydroxide nanoparticles are simply synthesized (size is about 50 nm) and deposited on the reduced graphene oxide nanoflake by the hydrothermal method. Then, the ability of glassy carbon electrode modified with this low-cost nanocomposite is examined as a supercapacitor and oxygen evolution electrocatalysts in 2.0 mol L-1 KOH by a three-electrode system.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we report a superior dehydrogenation catalyst for dimethylamine borane, which exhibited one of the best catalytic activities. The newly formed catalyst system contains well dispersed ruthenium-copper nanomaterials on reduced graphene oxide (3.86 +/- 0.47 nm), which was prepared by using the ultrasonic double reduction technique. The characterization of monodisperse ruthenium-copper alloy nanoparticles was performed using some advanced analytical methods such as TEM, HRTEM, XPS, Raman spectroscopic analysis. The experiments results revealed that the monodisperse ruthenium-copper alloy catalyst (RuCu@rGO) has one of the highest catalytic activity compared to previous studies, having a high turnover frequency value (256.70 h(-1)). The detailed kinetic parameters such as activation energy, enthalpy, and entropy values were also calculated for the dehydrogenation of dimethylamine borane at room temperature. Also, the results showed that the monodisperse RuCu@rGO catalyst has high durability and reusability as retained its 81% initial catalytic activity even after 4th runs for the dehydrogenation of dimethylamine borane.

M3  - Article
AB  - We have prepared a nanocomposite hybrid film to produce a collaborative network of gold (Au) nanoparticles that are highly dispersed on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets, and tested it for electrocatalytic hydrogen production. The RGO/Au nanocomposite film synthesized on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) allows significant improvements to the electron transfer process. The Au nanoparticles decorated on the surface of graphene increases the electron density, which synergistically promote the adsorption of hydrogen atoms on the graphene sheets and consequently enhance the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. The surface properties of the composite was characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and the electrocatalytical performances evaluated as prepared electrocatalyst toward (HER) by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), Tafel polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses. The GCE/RGO/Au nanohybrid electrode exhibited good catalytic activity for HER with an onset potential of -0.3 V and a Tafel slope of 136 mV dec(-1), achieving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of -0.43 V.

TI  - Au-Ni alloy nanoparticles supported on reduced graphene oxide as highly efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Bimetallic nanoparticles of Au and Ni in the form of alloy nanostructures with varying Ni content are synthesized on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets via a simple solution chemistry route and tested as electrocatalysts towards the hydrogen evolution (HE) and oxygen reduction (OR) reactions using polarization and impedance studies. The Au Ni alloy NPs/rGO nanocomposites display excellent electrocatalytic activity which is found to improve with increasing Ni content in the Au Ni/rGO alloy nanocomposites. For HER, the best Au Ni alloy NPs/rGO electrocatalyst, the one with the highest Ni content, exhibits high activity with an onset overpotential approaching zero versus the reversible hydrogen electrode and an overpotential of only 37 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Additionally, a low Tafel slope of 33 mV dec(-1) and a high exchange current density of 0.6 mA cm(-2) are measured which are very close to those of commercial Pt/C catalyst. Also, in the ORR tests, this electrocatalyst displays comparable activity to Pt/C. The Koutecky Levich plots referred to a 4 electron mechanism for the reduction of dissolved O-2 on the Au Ni alloy NPs/rGO catalyst. The electrocatalyst thus demonstrates excellent activity towards HER and ORR. Additionally, it exhibits outstanding operational durability and activation after 10,000th cycles assuring its practical applicability. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - TiO2-RGO hybrid nanomaterials for enhanced water splitting reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The production of H-2 via photocatalytic water splitting reaction has attracted a great attention as a clean and renewable energy for next generation. Despite tremendous efforts, the present challenge for materials scientist is to develop highly active photo catalysts for splitting of water at low cost. This article reports the synthesis of TiO2-reduced graphene oxide hybrid nanomaterials through ionothermal method using functionalized ionic liquid for the enhanced hydrogen generation via water splitting reaction. The structural and morphological properties of the samples were investigated by XFtD, Raman spectroscopy, TG-DTA, UV-vis spectroscopy and TEM. A substantial increase of H-2 evolution was observed for TiO2-reduced graphene oxide hybrid nanomaterials. This is due to the high migration efficiency of photo-induced electrons and the inhibition of charge carrier recombination due to the electronic interaction between TiO2 and reduced graphene oxide. i.e, reduced graphene oxide acts as an electron-acceptor which effectively hinders the electron hole pair recombination of TiO2.

TI  - Enhanced Electro-catalytic Activity of Nitrogen-doped Reduced Graphene Oxide Supported PdCu Nanoparticles for Formic Acid Electro-oxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Successful commercialization of direct formic acid fuel cells (DFAFCs) is restricted because of its apparent instability in acidic medium and high cost of typically noble metal based anode catalyst. To adequately address these key issues, in this work, a series of palladium-copper alloy catalyst supported on nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) were synthesized via wet chemical reduction process. Several microscopic and spectroscopic techniques were employed to determine the crystal pattern, particle size, composition and morphology of the synthesized material. Electro-catalytic performance of the synthesized catalysts was carefully verified with respect to formic acid oxidation. All N-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) supported catalyst show enhanced catalytic activity in comparison to commercial Pd/C catalyst. Electrochemical study reveals precisely that Pd75Cu25/N-rGO catalysts have highest electro catalytic activity 1738 mA mg(pd)(-1) among all synthesized catalyst which is 3.67 times higher than commercial Pd/C catalyst. Pd75Cu25/N-rGO catalyst show lowest Tafel slope (119 mV dec(-1)) and excellent stability after 250 potential cycles. These extensive studies signify that N-rGO support material can remarkably improve the catalytic activity and stability of the catalysts which may be due to outstanding electron transfer capability and synergy between PdCu metallic and N-rGO support. This work helps further design of alloy nanoparticles on N-rGO support as a highly active and stable catalyst for application in the fuel cell. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Preparation of anode catalysts for sorbitol electrooxidation based on the nanocomposites of fumed silica, reduced graphene oxide and gold nanoparticles
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, fumed silica (FS), reduced graphene oxide (rGO), and their hybrid (FS-rGO) are tested as support materials for Au nanoparticles to prepare anode catalysts for sorbitol fuel cells. Chemical reduction method is used to obtain Au@FS, Au@rGO, and Au@FS-rGO cat-alysts characterized by SEM, EDAX, TEM, XRD, and Raman analysis. The Au contents of the catalysts are determined as 32.5% (Au@FS), 32% (Au@rGO), and 32.8% (Au@FS-rGO). Di-ameters of Au nanoparticles are measured as 1.51 nm (Au@FS), 5.90 nm (Au@rGO), and 7.05 nm (Au@FS-rGO). The highest current density for sorbitol oxidation is obtained with Au@FS-rGO. The onset potential of sorbitol oxidation obtained with Au@FS-rGO (0.007 V) is much smaller than those of Au@FS (0.028 V) and Au@rGO (0.038 V), indicating the syner-gistic effect of FS and rGO. FS significantly increases the activity and stability of the cata-lysts compared to rGO one of the commonly researched support materials in fuel cells. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - One-pot co-reduction synthesis of orange-like Pd@Co@P nanoparticles supported on rGO for catalytic hydrolysis of ammonia borane
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Transition metal phosphide based orange-like Pd@Co@P nanoparticles supported on reduced graphene oxide (Pd@Co@P/rGO) have been synthesized by a one-pot co-reduction at room temperature using methylamine borane (MeAB) as the reducing agent. The prepared Pd@Co@P/rGO nanoparticles were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and confocal Raman microscopy (Raman). Compared with Pd/rGO and Pd@Co/rGO, the Pd@Co@P/rGO catalyst has higher catalytic activity for the hydrolytic production of ammonia borane (AB) with the turnover frequency value (TOF) of 127.57 min(-1) and the activation energy of 39.05 kJ mol(-1). This excellent catalytic performance may be caused by the orange-like structure and good dispersion of Pd@Co@P/rGO nanoparticles, and the synergistic electron interactions between palladium, cobalt, and phosphorus.

AB  - Bimetallic nanoparticles with extremely uniform dispersion on conductive-carbon supports are very much in need to improve the kinetics of sluggish electrochemical reactions relevant to fuel cell applications. Here, bimetallic platinum-cobalt (26.7 wt% Pt + 2.8 wt% Co on reduced graphene oxide with atomic composition of platinum-to-cobalt as 3:1) and platinum-nickel (26.8 wt% Pt + 2.8 wt% Ni on reduced graphene oxide support with atomic composition of platinum-to-nickel as 3:1) nanoparticles with high degree of uniform dispersion (average particle sizes of about 1-2.25 nm) on graphene oxide in its partially reduced form ('rGO') were fabricated by a simple one-pot chemical-based reduction method. A pomegranate peel extract was utilized to neutralize the high acidic graphene oxide (GO) formed during the chemical exfoliation of natural graphite and used along with metal precursors during the chemical reduction to achieve well-dispersed Pt3Ni/rGO and Pt3Co/rGO nanoparticles. The efficiencies towards electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of the synthesized catalysts were tested in different media (acidic and basic). In acidic medium, the ORR activity descriptors like mass-specific and area-specific current density as well potential at half-wave (E-1/2) are considerably higher for Pt3Ni/rGO nano catalysts than Pt3Co/rGO, Pt/rGO and Pt/C electrocatalysts. Interestingly, in basic medium the Pt3Co/rGO exhibit higher ORR activity among the other catalysts tested. The general facile fabrication strategy shown in this work is promising to extend to prepare other mono, bi and ternary metallic nanoparticles with high uniformity on carbon-based substrates to utilize as highly advanced electrocatalysts.

TI  - Spinel LiMn2O4 nanoparticles dispersed on nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide nanosheets as an efficient electrocatalyst for aluminium-air battery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide nanosheets modified with LiMn2O4 (LMO) nanoparticles as low cost, nontoxic and efficient catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) were synthesized by a simple two step hydrothermal method. The physical properties and the activity of the composites toward ORR were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra, and electrochemical measurements, including cyclic voltammograms (CV), steady state polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in O-2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. The LiMn2O4 supported on nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (LMO/N-rGO) showed more positive onset potential, half wave potential, faster charge transfer, and a higher cathodic peak current in alkaline media than that of LiMn2O4/rGO and N-rGO. Furthermore, air electrodes with hybrid catalysts were fabricated to test the discharged performance in Al-air batteries under ambient air condition. The batteries with LMO/N-rGO cathode displayed the higher energy density of 585 mAh g(-1) and sluggish potential drop. The improved catalytic activity and battery performance of LMO/N-rGO can be attributed to the effect of active sites induced by nitrogen, and synergic covalent coupling between the nitrogen-doped graphene sheets and spinel lithium manganese oxide. These results confirm that LMO/N-rGO is a promising material for air cathodes with good activity and stability in aluminium-air battery. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a simple and fast electrochemical method was employed to synthesis molybdenum diselenide thin film. The morphology, structure and chemical composition of the nanocomposites were investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The progressive effects of transition metal ions including Ni, Cu, and Co were surveyed on the hydrogen evolution activity of MoSe2 thin films. Co/MoSe2 nanocomposite thin films has significant electrocatalytic activity as compared to other samples, In order to achieve higher performance, preparing Co/MoSe2/RGO nanocomposite thin film, two strategies including layer by layer electrodeposition and co-electrodeposition has been employed. The presence of reduced graphene oxide leading to the onset potential shifts to more positive values and increase the current density. Also, results showed that the Co/MoSe2/RGO nanocomposite prepared by co-electrodeposition exhibits the best electrochemical hydrogen evolution at onset potential of -0.18 with an overpotential of -0.45 V.

M3  - Article
AB  - A Ni and MoxC hybrid (Ni-MoxC) supported on N-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) electrocatalyst with high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity was prepared by ultrasonication and lyophilization. Notably, benefiting from the synergistic effect between Ni and MoxC nanoparticles, the optimized electrocatalyst displayed excellent catalytic activity with low overpotentials of 183 mV and 216 mV for the HER at the current density 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. The stability of the electrocatalyst could be well maintained for 24 h. These results indicate that the method to prepare hybrid (Ni-MoxC) is a simple way to produce cost-effective and high-efficient molybdenum carbide for hydrogen evolution.

AB  - A three-dimensional (3D) reduced graphene oxide Mn3O4 nanosheet (Mn3O4@rGO) hybrid was achieved by simple electrodeposition technique. Small palladium nanoparticle were homogeneously anchored onto Mn3O4@rGO substrate through the reduction of palladium salt. The interpenetrating network architecture of Mn3O4@rGO greatly inhibited the aggregation of 2D sheets of Mn3O4 and rGO, and the open 3D orientation of the Mn3O4 rGO hybrid nanosheets on the electrode facilitated both mass transport and electron transfer as well as maximally exposed active sites. The introduction of Mn3O4 enhanced the structural and electrochemical stability of rGO. The as-synthesized Pd/Mn3O4 rGO hybrid was employed as an electrocatalyst for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The electrocatalyst showed a low overpotential of 20 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 48.2 mV dec(-1), and a large exchange current density of 0.59 mA cm(-2). Importantly, the catalyst possessed superior durability with 85.87% of catalytic activity after a long-time test (10 h). This work presents a simple and efficient stratagy to construct high-performance electrocatalysts for energy and environmental applications. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB  - Iron and cobalt materials have attracted enormous interest as low-cost alternatives to noble-metal catalysts able to catalyse oxygen reduction reaction. Here, the effect of the heteropolyacid H(3)PMo(12)o(40) (HPMo) into the structure of new composites formed by Fe, Co and reduced-graphene oxide/chitosan (rGOCS) has been investigated. Chitosan was used as a nitrogen precursor for nanocarbon, while reduced graphene oxide was introduced to tune the electrical conductivity. The physicochemical properties of electrocatalysts were performed "by Raman, XRD, XPS and TEM. Activity toward ORR was carried out in a three electrode electrochemical cell using a rotating disk electrode (RDE). The molybdophosphoric acid incorporation into the structure of Fe/rGOCS composites resulted in an increase of the activity of the oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline medium. Furthermore, the replacement of iron by cobalt yielded in a great improvement of the activity and stability, which may open new avenues for the design of nanomaterials utilizing HPMo/reducedgraphene oxide/chitosan composites.

AB  - A new type of potassium niobate/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) composite nanoscrolls was prepared by the intercalation of RGO in the process of curling of the potassium niobate nanosheets. The as-prepared potassium niobate/RGO composite nanoscrolls were characterized with powder X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, solid diffuse reflectance UV-visible spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy. The photocatalytic activity of the composite nanoscrolls was evaluated by hydrogen evolution from aqueous methanol under UV irradiation. It was found that the photocatalytic activity was enhanced as 3.1 times after introducing 2% RGO, compared with the pure potassium niobate nanoscrolls. It was ascribed to the enhanced separation efficiency of electron/hole pairs as testified by electrochemical impedance spectrum and fluorescence spectrum. Moreover, the composite photocatalyst was stable and easy to be recycled. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - MATERIALS RESEARCH BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Herein, we discuss the synthesis of reduced graphene oxide and TiO2 (rGO-TiO2) nanocomposites with varying ratios of rGO to TiO2 by hydrothermal method. Photocatalytic ability of the nanocomposites was assessed for H-2 production under natural sunlight. At 5 wt% GO loading, the rGO-TiO2 exhibited 24,880 mu mol/g/h H-2, 12.9 times to commercial P25-TiO2 (1920 mu mol/g/h). The symmetric supercapacitor device fabricated using rGO-TiO2 demonstrated 160 F/g specific capacitance with 99% retention. The efficient charge carrier separation and transportation between TiO2 nanotubes and rGO resulted high photocatalytic activity. The synergistic double layer pseudo capacitor behavior of rGO-TiO2 is the reason for improved specific capacitance.

AB  - The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to value-added products is one of the useful approaches to reducing the effects of global climate change. Herein, a novel electrocatalyst consisting of platinum nanoparticles on histamine-reduced graphene oxide plates (Pt@His-rGO) supported by a glassy carbon (GC) substrate for the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to methanol has been developed. The nanocomposite was optimized in terms of pH, applied potential, CO2 purging time and platinum loading for the highest current densities and faradaic efficiencies toward methanol production. The best results were obtained in a solution containing KNO3 0.1 mol L-1 at the pH of 2.0, the applied potential of -0.3 V vs Ag/AgCl (KClsat), CO2 purging duration of 30 min and Pt loading of 5.17 x 10(-7) mol cm(-2). The faradaic efficiency of 37% was obtained for methanol production. The prepared nanocomposite requires a lower applied potential and serves as an intermediate stabilizer through the production of methanol. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, porous Mn3O4-Fe3O4 nanoparticles with highly uniform composition are in -situ anchored on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets by a simple cyanometallic framework template method. Thanks to the synergistic effects between the porous Mn3O4-Fe3O4 nanoparticles and the well-conductive rGO nanosheets, the Mn3O4-Fe3O4/rGO composites present superior electrochemical lithium storage performances with a great reversible capacity of 1013 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1, satisfactory rate capability of 510 mAh g-1at 3.0 A g-1, and eminent long-term cycle stability of 804 mAh g-1 after 500 cycles at 0.5 A g-1. It is demonstrated that the rGO can not only act as a conducting matrix, but also buffer the volume expansion and avoid the aggregation of the Mn3O4-Fe3O4 nanoparticles during charging-discharging. The work provides a simple strategy for designing and fabricating advanced multi-component metal oxide-based anodes for high-performance lithium-ion battery.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present work, a porous carbonaceous platform containing zirconium oxide was used for spreading Ni nanoparticles, and applied to methanol oxidation. The platform was obtained by calcination of a metal-organic framework (MOF) attached to graphene oxide. Nickel nanoparticles were then deposited on the nanocomposite by chemical reduction from a Ni2+ solution. The obtained electrocatalyst was characterized by different methods. An excellent electrocatalytic behavior was observed towards methanol oxidation in alkaline medium (j similar to 240 mA cm(-2) or similar to 626 mA mg(-1) in 1.0 M methanol). The results of methanol oxidation by various electrochemical studies (cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, chronoamperometry and chronopotentiometry) revealed the effective synergy between reduced graphene oxide, porous carbon material, ZrO2 metal oxide and Ni nanoparticles. Good durability and stability of the proposed electrocatalyst and significantly increased current density of methanol oxidation suggest it as a potential alternative for Pt-based electrocatalysts in direct methanol fuel cells.

TI  - Monodisperse nickel-palladium alloy nanoparticles supported on reduced graphene oxide as highly efficient catalysts for the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Addressed herein is the catalysis of reduced graphene oxide-supported monodisperse NiPd alloy nanoparticles (NPs) (rGO-NiPd) in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane (AB). This is the first example of the use of NiPd alloy NPs as catalyst in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of AB. Monodisperse NiPd alloy NPs (3.5 nm) were synthesized by co-reduction of nickel(II) acetate and palladium(II) acetylacetonate in oleylamine (OAm) and borane-tert-butylamine complex (BTB) at 100 degrees C. The current recipe allowed to control the composition of NiPd alloy NPs and to study the composition-controlled catalysis of rGO-NiPd in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of AB. Among the all compositions tested, the Ni30Pd70 was the most active one with the turnover frequency of 28.7 min(-1). The rGO-Ni30Pd70 were also durable catalysts in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of AB providing 3650 total turnovers in 35 h and reused at six times without deactivation. The detailed reaction kinetics of hydrolytic dehydrogenation of AB revealed that the reaction proceeds first order with respect to the NiPd concentration and zeroth order with respect to the AB concentration. The apparent activation energy of the catalytic dehydrogenation of AB was also calculated to be E-a(app)=45 +/- 2 kJ*mol(-1). Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

TI  - CdS@h-BN heterointerface construction on reduced graphene oxide nanosheets for hydrogen production
T2  - APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar light driven hydrogen evolution is a prospective strategy to solve the energy problem. However, the poor photoresponse, low photocurrent density and easy electron-hole recombination remarkably restrict the HER activity of the conventional photocatalyst. Herein, we constructed a CdS@hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) heterostructure on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to synthesize a ternary CdS@h-BN/rGO catalyst via a structural reconstruction strategy. The CdS@h-BN heterointerface promoted the electrons transferring to the CdS active centers from the valence band of h-BN under photoinduction, overcoming the wide bandgap defect of pristine h-BN. The easily photoexcited property of CdS cocatalyst resulted in superhigh photocurrent density (2.7.mu A cm(-2)) under simulated solar light, which was 3.3-fold greater of pristine CdS NPs. Meanwhile, the interfacial interactions of three components remarkably restrained the carriers recombination. Hence, the resultant ternary hybrid catalyst presented remarkably improved photoresponse and interfacial conductivity, thereby the optimal catalyst represented remarkably enhanced HER activity (6465.33 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)) under simulated solar light, which was about 10.9-fold greater of the pristine CdS NPs and 218.3-fold greater of the optimal h-BN/rGO hybrid. About 19.8 % of apparent quantum yield was achieved under illumination of lambda =420 nm, and the excellent regenerability and durability were represented during six cycles and 20 h of continued illumination. Thereby, this study provides a prospective idea for constructing low-cost nonprecious metal based photocatalyst with highly efficient HER performance.

TI  - Growth control of cobalt oxide nanoparticles on reduced graphene oxide for enhancement of electrochemical capacitance
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The high capacitance and cyclic stability of graphene nanosheets decorated with Co3O4 nanoparticles as a material for supercapacitor electrodes are reported here. Hydrothermal method is adopted to deposit cobalt oxides on the reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets in a mixture of water and dimethylformamide (DMF) as the solvent with different volume ratios. The water volume ratio presents a crucial factor in the nucleation and growth process. In addition, it affects dispersion, particle size and the amount of nucleated cobalt oxide particle on the graphene sheets. By decreasing the water volume, the nucleation and growth occur mainly on graphene rather than in solution. According to the obtained results from transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis, a model for growth of nanoparticles on graphene sheets is proposed. Based on the obtained results, the presented model can also be used for the synthesis of other graphene-metal (oxide) composites. Electrochemical measurements indicate that water volume ratio in the mixture solvent influences on capacitance of the RGO/Co3O4 composite electrodes. The highest obtained specific capacitance is 440.4 F g(-1) with 50% volume ratio of water at current density of 5 A g(-1). Copyright (c) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

TI  - Monodisperse Pd nanoparticles assembled on reduced graphene oxide-Fe3O4 nanocomposites as electrocatalysts for borohydride fuel cells
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 5 nm palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) are synthesized and assembled on reduced graphene oxide-iron oxide nanocomposite (rGO-Fe3O4) to be used in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and borohydride oxidation reaction (BOR) studies in alkaline media. The structure and morphology of the resulting Pd/rGO-Fe3O4 hybrid material are evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analyses. The electrochemical behavior of Pd/rGO-Fe3O4 hybrid material for the ORR and BOR is investigated by voltammetry with rotating disk and rotating ring disk electrode and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, enabling evaluation of the number of exchanged electrons, Tafel slope, exchange current density and activation energy. The results reveal that ORR at Pd/rGO-Fe3O4 proceeds as a 2-electron process with Tafel slope of 0.133 V dec(-1), while BOR proceeds as a 5.6-electron process with Tafel slope of 0.350 V dec(-1) and exchange current density of 1.38 mA cm(-2). The BOR activation energy was found to be 12.4 kJ mol(-1). Overall, this study demonstrates the good efficiency of Pd/rGO-Fe3O4 hybrid material for BOR. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB  - Heteroatom (N, B and P) doped reduced graphene oxide (RGO)-metal chalcogenide nanocomposites (RGO-Cd0.60Zn0.40S) were prepared by the solvothermal method, and then they were characterized with X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and photoluminescence techniques. Doping of RGO with heteroatoms of N, B and P increased charge-transfer capability of nanocomposites and thus, improved both photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical hydrogen production activities of them. N-doped RGO-Cd0.60Zn0.40S photocatalyst exhibited the highest photocatalytic hydrogen production rate (1114 mu molh(-1) g(-1)) in photocatalytic (PC) system amongst other and it was 1.5 times higher than that of RGO-Cd0.60Zn0.40S photocatalyst. Having a current density of 0.92 mAcm(-2), photoelectrochemical hydrogen production activity of N-RGO-Cd0.60Zn0.40S electrode was found to be 3 times higher than RGO-Cd0.60Zn0.40S photoelectrode without any applied bias potential under visible light irradiation in photoelectrochemical system. In general, these results clearly showed that heteroatom doping of RGO led to promising materials for renewable hydrogen production in the photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical systems.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Enzymatic biofuel cells offer a new avenue of eco-friendly energy generation which is highly essential to establish a sustainable energy infrastructure. Herein, a hybrid fuel cell using an immobilised enzyme-based anode, a hydrogel-based separator and a glucose tolerant catalyst based cathode has been fabricated and demonstrated. Multiwalled carbon nanotube-pyrene carboxylic acid (MWCNT-PCA) nanocomposite based anode has been used for the electrostatic immobilisation of glucose oxidase enzyme. Agar-polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel is used as the separator which supplies the fuel cell with 500 mM glucose solution. Reduced graphene oxide-ceria (rGC) acts as the glucose tolerant non-enzymatic cathode catalyst. A sandwiched construction is used to fabricate the device with which an open circuit potential of 140 mV has been recorded with a peak power density of 6.25 mu W/cm(2) at 60 mu A/cm(2).

TI  - Preparation of carbon nanotube and graphene doped polyphenylene sulfide flexible film electrodes and the electrodeposition of Cu2O nanocrystals for hydrogen-generation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Through annealing and electrochemical reduction methods, we successfully fabricates reduced graphene oxide layer (RGOL) modified carbon nanotube and reduced graphene oxide (CNT + RGO) doped polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) flexible thin film electrodes. These composite structure films can not only overcome the brittle nature of PPS, but also make good use of the thermal stability of PPS. Furthermore, carbon nanotube and reduced graphene oxide enhance the electrical conductivity of the composite films. Truncated octahedral and cuboctahedral Cu2O nanocrystals are synthesized on RGOL modified CNT + RGO doped PPS (RGOL@PPS/CNT + RGO) composite film by a facile electrodeposition method without using any surfactants or external heating. RGOL on the PPS/CNT + RGO substrate facilitates the formation of Cu2O morphology. The obtained Cu2O composite film shows a superior ability for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) compared with other Cu2O electrocatalysts. The Cu2O with a smaller loading less than 0.04 mg cm(-2) on the composite film exhibits excellent HER activities with a low onset potential of 0.05 V and large current densities. The results of the HER performance indicates that the RGOL@PPS/CNT + RGO composite film has a potential application in flexible hydrogen-producing devices. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Facile hydrothermal procedure to synthesize sheet-on-sheet reduced graphene oxide (RGO)/CuxO-CeO2 nanocomposites for preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The sheet-on-sheet reduced graphene oxide (RGO)/CuxO-CeO2 catalysts were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal procedure and systematically characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and N2 adsorption desorption techniques. It is found that there is a large amount of reduced copper species in the RGO/CuxO-CeO2 catalysts, and the addition of RGO was beneficial for the dispersion of particles and the improvement of textural properties. The spherical nanoparticles of copper species can be served as spacers to prevent the stacking of RGO. Copper and cerium species are homogenously distributed on the surface of RGO sheets. The introduction of RGO improves the formation of high Ce3+ concentration and oxygen vacancies. Therefore, the RGO/CuxO-CeO2 catalysts show higher catalytic activity than the CuO-CeO2 catalyst at low temperature (below 135 degrees C). Moreover, good resistance to H2O and CO2 of the RGO/CuxO-CeO2 may be from for the formation of hydroxyl groups by dissociative adsorption of H2O on the surface of RGO, which can improve the WGS reaction and the decomposition of carbonates.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - SnO2/graphene nanosheet composite is fabricated by a simple hydrothermal method, characterized by SnO2 nanoparticles as small as 4 nm anchored on the reduced graphene oxide nanosheets by L-ascorbic acid (SnO2/L-RGO). The as-made SnO2/L-RGO composite exhibits excellent lithium storage performance with the high initial discharge and charge capacities around 2004.9 and 1262.1 mA h g(-1) at the current density of 100 mA g(-1). The SnO2/L-RGO electrode also exhibits high reversible capacity with the 660.8 mA h g(-1) remained after 300 cycles at the high current density of 500 mA g(-1). Moreover, the SnO2/LRGO electrode shows exceptional rate capability. The experimental results indicate that the combination of reduced graphene oxide by L-AA significantly boosts the cycling stability and rate capacity performance of SnO2 by effectively accommodating the large volume variation as well preventing the electrode from pulverization.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The synergistic effect of 3D carbon support on Pd-based catalyst and its performance toward direct alcohol oxidation reaction is reported here. The surface of 3DrGO-MWCNTs support was modified by loading different amounts (5-20 wt%) of cerium oxide (CeO2) by wet impregnation method. Further, Pd nanoparticles were dispersed over CeO2/3DrGO-MWCNTs nanocomposites by chemical reduction method. The synthesized nanocomposites were characterized by various techniques such as XRD, XRF, SEM, TEM, Raman, and XPS analysis. The electro-oxidation performance and long-term stability of the Pd/CeO2/3DrGO-MWCNTs electro-catalyst were measured by CV, LSV, and CA analysis. The modification of the catalysts surface by cerium oxide Pd/10CeO(2)/3DrGO-MWCNTs leads to a higher anodic peak current of about138.43 mA/cm(2) and 91.72 mA/cm(2) when compared to the Pd/3DrGO-MWCNTs and Pd/C for ethanol and methanol electro-oxidation. In addition, the catalyst showed the highest electro chemical active surface area. The present work demonstrates a possible way to fabricate a nanostructure catalyst to improve the performance of electro-catalytic reactions. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Facile synthesis of reduced graphene oxide supported PtAg nanoflowers and their enhanced electrocatalytic activity
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, a simple and facile method is developed in the synthesis of well-dispersed PtAg nanoflowers on reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (PtAg/RGOs) under solvothermal conditions, using ethylene glycol as a reducing agent and hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) as capping and stabilizing agents. The as-prepared nanocomposites show a superior electrocatalytic activity, good tolerance, and better stability toward the oxidation of formic acid and ethylene glycol in alkaline media, compared with the commercial Pt/C (10 wt%) catalyst. For the oxidation of formic acid, the PtAg nanoflowers own thirty times higher of the catalytic currents than those of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Meanwhile, for the oxidation of ethylene glycol, the ratio of forward current (j(F)) to reverse current (j(R)) is high up to 8.4, which is almost four times higher than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. This strategy provides a promising platform for direct formic acid and ethylene glycol fuel cells. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Composite of manganese dioxide and electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (MnO2/ERGO) was prepared and investigated as active material in supercapacitor. In order to synthesize the nanocomposite, a thin film of graphene oxide (GO) was formed by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique from an aqueous dispersion of GO on stainless steel (SS). GO/SS was electrochemically reduced to form ERGO. Two-step potential method was used to deposit MnO2 on ERGO/SS. MnO2 nanoparticles with dimensions in the range of 40-70 nm were formed as a uniform coating on ERGO/SS. Specific capacitance of MnO2/ERGO/SS is 392 F g(-1) at current density of 1 A g(-1) in 0.5 M Na2SO4, which was higher than 159 F g(-1) for ERGO/SS. Also, MnO2/ERGO/SS shows higher power and energy densities than ERGO/SS. Due to unique structure of prepared MnO2/ERGO nanocomposite, the capacitive behavior of ERGO is improved.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, monazite-type strontium chromate (SrCrO4) as a ternary metal oxide was prepared by the sol-gel method. Nitrogen and sulfur co-doped graphene decorated with SrCrO4 nanocrystals was synthesized successfully, and the electrochemical hydrogen storage performance of the SrCrO4 and its relative nanocomposites also were investigated by chronopotentiometry (CHP) technique. The effect of doped graphene as a substrate of the SrCrO4 sample on the improvement of the electrochemical hydrogen storage performance was considered as well. The SrCrO4-nitrogen and sulfur co-doped graphene (SrCrO4/NSG) displayed the highest discharge capacity in comparison to SrCrO4-reduced graphene oxide (SrCrO4/rGO), SrCrO4 calcined at 1000 degrees C (SrCrO4 (1000)) and SrCrO4 calcined at 800 degrees C (SrCrO4 (800)). Also, increasing the hydrogen storage capacity of the samples by repeating the cycles indicated the excellent cycle stability of the nanoparticles. In monazite-type structures, oxygen vacancies can be created by thermal treatment. Creating oxygen vacancies can improve redox reactions, which increase the conductivity of the samples and hydrogen storage capacity. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

MoP nanoparticle assemblies in composite with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) have been introduced with superior electrocatalytic performances in hydrogen generation from both acidic and alkaline media. The composite drives HER with a current density similar to 210 mA cm(-2) at a potential of 400 mV vs. RHE and requires only similar to 80-90 mV to start hydrogen evolution in both media. This composite remains stable and durable for hydrogen evolution in an acidic medium after 20 hours of chrono-potentiometric studies at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2). Electrochemical hydrogen evolution studies show that an rGO based composite synthesized by an aniline complexation method exhibits higher catalytic efficiency than a composite synthesized by the citric acid complexation method. Detailed mechanistic investigations in both acidic and alkaline media have been carried out using impedance spectroscopy and the Tafel slope.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, Ni-Al/layered double hydroxide is decorated on reduced graphene oxide (Ni-Al/LDH(#)rGOs) and ruthenium oxide is decorated on the surface of exfoliated graphene oxide (RuO2-EGO). Then, RuO2-EGO is used to synthesize a modified LDH as Ni-Al/(LDHRuO2)-Ru-#-EGO. The structures and compositions of the nanohybrids, including Ni-Al/LDH(#)rGOs, RuO2-EGO, and Ni-Al/(LDHRuO2)-Ru-#-EGO are verified using different techniques such as transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, FT-IR and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller. In a second stage of the study, the nanohybrids are investigated for their electrochemical hydrogen generation capabilities. Also, due to the instability of LDHs in acidic media, chemical etching of Ni-Al/(LDHRuO2)-Ru-#-EGO is used to prepare three-dimensional RuO2-EGO (TD-RuO2-EGO). Electrochemical results show that while TD-RuO2-EGO nanohybrid is superior in electrocatalytic activity to the other nanohybrids investigated, its hydrogen generation properties including onset potential, Tafel slope and stability are comparable with those of commercial Pt/C.

TI  - Ultrafine palladium nanoparticles anchored on NH2-functionalized reduced graphene oxide as efficient catalyst towards formic acid dehydrogenation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of active and stable catalyst is of significance for hydrogen generation from formic acid. Herein, a novel palladium catalyst with ultrafine metallic nanoparticles anchored on NH2-functionalized reduced graphene oxide (NH2-rGO) was synthesized by a facile wet chemical reduction process using sodium borohydride as the reducing agent. The TEM and XPS characterization results confirmed the successful functionalization of rGO with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), which plays a very important role in evenly dispersing ultrafine Pd nanoparticles with a small average size of about 2.3 nm. As a result, the as-prepared Pd/NH2-rGO catalyst exhibited excellent activity with a high initial turnover frequency of 767 h(-1) and 100% hydrogen selectivity, which was predominant among the currently available pure Pd catalysts towards formic acid dehydrogenation under room temperature.

TI  - Synthesis and electrocatalytic alcohol oxidation performance of Pd-Co bimetallic nanoparticles supported on graphene
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Magnetic Pd-Co bimetallic nanoparticles supported on reduced graphene oxide sheets (Pd-Co/RGO) with excellent electrocatalytic performance have been synthesized by a rapid reducing method, using sodium hypophosphite as the reducing agent. The loading and crystalline phase of cobalt in the Pd-Co/RGO hybrids varied as to the initial amount of cobalt salt and reducing agent. Transmission electron microscopy images show that the mean size of the Pd-Co bimetallic nanoparticles was about 10-13 nm and without significant agglomeration. At the same Pd loading on graphene, the current densities of the forward anodic peak of the different Pd-Co/RGO catalysts was decreased by about 25% when compared with that of the pure Pd nanoparticles supported on reduced graphene oxide for both methanol and ethanol oxidation. However, chronoamperometry tests confirmed that the stability was increased by up to 240% and 225% for methanol oxidation and ethanol oxidation, respectively. It is hypothesized that the Co layer on Pd partially blocks Pd sites sacrificing a small portion of the activity of the catalysts, but it leaves the remaining Pd more active and thus enhances alcohol oxidation kinetics and tolerance to poisoning intermediates. Catalytic performance of the Pd-Co/RGO hybrids for alcohol oxidation is primarily affected by the interaction among Pd, Co, and graphene. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

TI  - Modification of Ag nanoparticles/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites with a small amount of Au for glycerol oxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface modification of Ag nanoparticles supported on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) with a small amount of Au and the activity of Au-modified Ag/RGO (Au-Ag/RGO) catalysts for the electrooxidation of glycerol have been investigated. The deposition of Au on Ag/RGO nanocomposites was performed electrochemically, and the Au-Ag/RGO catalysts with Au:Ag atomic ratios in a range from 1:303 to 1:43 were prepared. The characterization of catalysts reveals a partial coverage of the Ag nanoparticle surface by Au adatoms. Cyclic voltammetric measurements indicate that the Au-Ag/RGO catalysts show almost the same activity as Au/RGO in terms of the geometric surface area of glassy carbon substrates for glycerol oxidation in alkaline solution, while Ag/RGO shows no catalytic activity. The Au Ag/RGO catalysts have great advantages over Au/RGO in terms of the Au mass specific activity. A significant improvement in the catalytic activity of Ag/RGO by the deposition of a small amount of Au and a high utilization of Au are achieved, and the result is of significance for preparing highly active catalysts at low cost by using less expensive metal and active metal.

TI  - Doping composite of polyaniline and reduced graphene oxide with palladium nanoparticles for room-temperature hydrogen-gas sensing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A composite consisting of polyaniline (PANI) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was synthesized by in situ polymerization of the monomer aniline in the presence of rGO under acidic conditions. The PANI-rGO composite substrate was doped with Pd nanoparticles via chemical reduction. The resulting Pd PANI-rGO nanocomposite was characterized by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy before it was utilized to fabricate a hydrogen sensor. Compared with the sensor based on PANI-rGO or PANI, the Pd PANI-rGO sensor was highly sensitive and selective to hydrogen gas, with fast response time in air at room temperature. The significantly enhanced sensitivity resulted from the faster spill-over effect, dissociation of hydrogen molecules on Pd, and the high surface area of the PANI-GO composite. Based on its improved sensing properties, ease of fabrication, and stable operation, the Pd PANI-rGO nanocomposite shows promise for high-performance hydrogen-sensing applications.

TI  - In situ electrodeposition of CoP nanoparticles on carbon nanomaterial doped polyphenylene sulfide flexible electrode for electrochemical hydrogen evolution
T2  - APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Active and durable electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is pivotal to generate molecular hydrogen more energy-efficient, but directly grafting electrocatalyst on electrode material by a single-step method without compromising the catalytic activity and stability remains a challenge. Herein, an intriguing electrode, reduced graphene oxide modified carbon nanotube/reduced graphene oxide/polyphenylene sulfide (RGO-CNT/RGO/PPS) film, is used to replace conventional electrodes. In situ electrode-position is proposed to fabricate CoP on the RGO-CNT/RGO/PPS (CoP-RGO-CNT/RGO/PPS) electrode and achieves a favorably electrical contact between CoP nanoparticles and RGO-CNT/RGO/PPS electrode due to without any polymer binder. Additionally, the coupling of different electrodeposition stages with scanning electron microscope (SEM) can investigate the nanostructure evolution of CoP nanoparticles, which gives valuable insights into the optimized electrodeposition cycles. The rational integration of RGO onto CNT/RGO/PPS film is an effective approach for enhancing its intrinsic electrical conductivity and favoring the formation of a high density of dispersive CoP nanoparticles. The CoP-RGO-CNT/RGO/PPS film has shown outstanding HER electrocatalytic behaviors performed a current density of 10 mA cm (2) at a relatively low overpotential of 160 mV with a Tafel slope of 60 mV dec (1) in acidic medium, which can be mainly attributed to the synergistic effect between optimized morphology and accelerated kinetics. Additionally, this film electrocatalyst exhibits a good HER activity and stability under both neutral and basic conditions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The disadvantages of high cost, easy poisoning and insufficient durability hinder platinum (Pt) application in direct methanol fuel cells. In this study, a hybrid of reduced graphene oxide/carbon nanotubes-supported hollow copper spheres (Cu/rGO@CNTs) is prepared by a one-step electrodeposition method. Then, the internal and external surfaces of hollow Cu spheres are coated with Pt skims to obtain a hollow bimetallic electrocatalyst (Pt/Cu/rGO@CNTs) through a simple galvanic replacement reaction by immersing Cu/rGO@CNTs in a chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) solution. The three dimensional rGO@CNTs network structure benefit mass transport and electron transfer. Pt skims expose abundant active sites for electrocatalytic methanol oxidation reactions (MORs). Cu cores synergize Pt skims to enhance anti-poison ability. As a result, Pt/Cu/rGO@CNTs shows an excellent electrocatalytic activity for MORs with a robust tolerance of catalyst poisoning.

CP  - International Conference on Electrochemical Materials and Technologies for Clean Sustainable Energy (ICES)
CL  - Guangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - A rutile and anatase mixed crystal phase of nano-rod TiO2 and TiO2-reduced graphene oxide (TiO2-RGO) nanocomposites with small particle size were prepared via a facile hydrothermal approach with titanium tetrabutoxide and graphene oxide as the precursor. Hydrolysis of titanium tetrabutoxide and mild reduction of graphene oxide were simultaneously carried out. Compared with traditional multistep methods, a novel green synthetic route to produce TiO2-RGO without toxic solvents or reducing agents was employed. TiO2-RGO as anode of lithium ion batteries was characterized by extensive measurements. The nanocomposites exhibited notable improvement in lithium ion insertion/extraction behavior compared with TiO2, indicating an initial irreversible capacity and a reversible capacity of 295.4 and 112.3 mA h g(-1) for TiO2-RGO after 100 cycles at a high charge rate of 10 C. The enhanced electrochemical performance is attributed to increased conductivity in presence of reduced graphene oxide in TiO(2-)RGO, a rutile and anatase mixed crystal phase of nano-rod TiO2/GNS composites, small size of TiO2 particles in nanocomposites, and enlarged electrode-electrolyte contact area, leading to more electroactive sites in TiO2-RGO.

T2  - IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This research work aims at proposing cheap, facile, sensitive, and selective assembly of three electrode electrochemical hydrogen (H-2) gas sensor which operates on room temperature in ambient conditions. Palladium oxide-reduced graphene oxide (PdO-rGO) nanocomposite have been synthesized using insitu chemical sol-gel method and modified Hummer's method. The phase, structure, particle size, and bonding information have been obtained using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectroscopy. Palladium oxide (PdO) nanoparticles of size ranging from 30 to 35 nm have been successfully attached with uniform 2D network of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets which offers a large surface area for H-2 adsorption. The thin film of nanocomposite have been fabricated on conducting Indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates using electrophoretic deposition (EPD) process and is employed as working electrode (WE) in indigenously developed three-electrode cell. Thin film surface morphology have been observed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and it shows agglomerates of PdO nanoparticles with multiple randomly stacked rGO nanosheets uniformly spread across the surface of the film. The amperometric response of the assembled electrochemical sensor has been recorded for the detection of 10 to 80 percent concentration of hydrogen gas using potentiostat/galvanostat autolab. The sensitivity of the sensor is found out to be 0.462 mu Al% H-2 concentration and sensing calibration curve shows a uniform linear response. The stability and selectivity of the sensor has been enhanced using H-2 insensitive reference electrode (RE) and solid polymer electrolyte gas permeable membrane, respectively, which will aid new dimensions in designing robust H-2 sensor at room temperature.

TI  - Improved photocatalytic activity of CdS/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) for H-2 evolution by strengthening the connection between CdS and RGO sheets
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - CdS were synthesised in situ on graphene oxide (GO) using a simple solvothermal method. GO in the prepared powders was then photoreduced into RGO to form the CdS/GO composites. The samples were characterised by using the X-ray diffraction spectra (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), fluorescence spectrum and Raman spectrum. The prepared CdS/RGO exhibited much higher activity for H-2 evolution than CdS or CdS mechanically loaded with GO under visible light irradiation (>420 nm). The improved photocatalyst performance of CdS/RGO was attributed to enhancement of the connection between CdS and RGO sheets, which accelerates the effect of the separation of photoinduced electrons and holes by transferring the photoinduced electron to RGO sheets.Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

TI  - MoS2/sulfur and nitrogen co-doped reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite for enhanced electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cost-effective materials for electrocatalytic water splitting are key to renewable energy research. In this work, MoS2/sulfur and nitrogen co-doped reduced graphene oxide (SNG) nanocomposite was produced via a two-step hydrothermal process. The formation of nanocomposite was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It is found that the MoS2/SNG nanocomposite exhibits much higher catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) relative to MoS2 and MoS2/RGO catalysts, as manifested by much larger cathodic current density with smaller overpotential of -120 mV and lower Tafel slope of 45 mV dec(-1). It is believed that the outstanding performance is attributed to the high electronic conductivity of SNG for fast charge transport. This study highlights the significance of the strong electronic coupling effect between the MoS2 and SNG in the enhancement of HER electrocatalytic activity.

TI  - Creation of heterojunction in CdS supported on N, S-rGO for efficient charge separation for photo-reduction of water to hydrogen
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - An efficient CdS supported on nitrogen and sulfur-doped reduced graphene oxide (N,S-rGO) has been prepared by a high-temperature gas-solid reaction for the first time. This catalyst was about ten times more efficient compared to pristine CdS in the dissociation of water to hydrogen. The high-temperature gas-solid reaction promotes chemical interaction between CdS and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) forming a heterojunction at the interface for transfer of photogenerated electrons from CdS to rGO. Doping of rGO with N and S enhances electron mobility and charge carrier density on the surface of the catalyst. The synergy between the efficient electron transfer, the enhanced electron mobility and the high charge carrier density results in a high activity of the prepared catalyst for photo-reduction of water to hydrogen. A detailed microstructural analysis for understanding the interaction amongst preparation technique, microstructure and activity, is also presented. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

T2  - ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Pt and Pt-Au nanoparticles supported on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) were synthesized by reverse microemulsion method with metal loading of 20 wt% and 10: 10 wt%, respectively. The nanomaterials were characterized by Raman, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis and transmission electronic microscope. The obtained materials were evaluated as electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR), obtaining the highest catalytic activity with Pt-Au/rGO compared to Pt/rGO; besides, the stability of the catalyst is determined until 50,000 cycles. Pt-Au/rGO was used to prepare membrane electrode assembly (MEA), in order to study the performance of this nanomaterial in the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). The maximum power density is 20 mW cm(-2) and 70 mW cm(-2) for Pt/rGO and Pt-Au/rGO, respectively, those values increased up to 365 mW cm(-2), when Pt-Au nanoparticles supported on multiwall carbon nanotubes (CNT) was used as spacer.

AB  - Although direct formic acid fuel cell (DFAFC) is regarded as one of the most promising energy-conversion systems, its commercialization process is impeded by the high costs of electrode catalysts as well as the sluggish catalytic reaction kinetics. Herein, we present a convenient bottom-up method to the synthesis of nanosized Pd crystals grown on 3D porous hybrid nanoarchitectures constructed from MXene (Ti3C2Tx) and reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (Pd/MX-rGO) through a co-assembly process. The as-derived 3D Pd/MX-rGO nanoarchitecture is equipped with a number of attractive textural features, such as 3D cross-linked porous networks, large specific surface area, uniform Pd dispersion, optimized electronic structure, and good electron conductivity. As a result, unusual formic acid oxidation properties in terms of high catalytic activity, strong poison tolerance, and reliable long-term stability are achieved for the 3D Pd/MX-rGO catalyst, significantly superior to those for conventional Pd catalysts supported by carbon black, graphene, and Ti3C2Tx matrixes.

TI  - Reduced graphene oxide modified CuBi2O4 as an efficient and noble metal free photocathode for superior photoelectrochemical hydrogen production
T2  - SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS
M3  - Article
AB  - Photoelectrochemical water splitting (PEC) is considered to be one of the proficient approaches for converting perpetual solar energy into chemical energy. Finding new materials which are earth abundant and economical is crucial in commercializing this technology in future. Herein, we have proposed noble metal free, p-type CuBi2O4 directly fabricated over FTO, overlaid with reduced graphene oxide (RGO). CuBi2O4 with an optimized number of RGO deposition cycles displayed the highest current density, which is similar to 2 times higher than that of the bare CuBi2O4 photocathode. An average faradaic efficiency of 91.7% was achieved, indicating that the photocurrent generated in the RGO modified CuBi2O4 photocathode is attributed solely to the water reduction. With RGO modification over CuBi2O4, charge carrier density increases from 3.76 x 10(20) cm(-3) to 7.92 x 10(20) cm(-3). A significant increase in carrier density indicates enhanced charge injection as well as separation owing to an efficient charge transfer from CuBi2O4 to RGO through favourable band alignment. Furthermore, open circuit potential decay (OCPD) measurements indicate enhanced charge separation with the introduction of graphene oxide into CuBi2O4.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing novel and efficient electrocatalysts is vital to overcome most of the technical and economic issues associated with the hydrogen production via water electrolysis. Herein, Pd-based alloy nanoparticles, namely AuPd and FePd, assembled on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) are investigated as cathode electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline water electrolysis. TEM, HR-TEM, XRD and ICP-MS are used to carry out the structural and morphological characterisation of the as -prepared rGO-AuPd and rGO-FePd nanocomposites and their electrocatalytic activity and stability is studied by voltammetry and chronoamperometry measurements. rGO-AuPd and rGO-FePd show HER onset overpotentials of 80 and 140 mV, respectively. A Tafel slope of 149 mV dec(-1) is evaluated for rGO-AuPd at 25 degrees C, while rGO-FePd has worse performance. It is shown that rGO-AuPd nanocomposites are good candidates for application as novel electrocatalysts for the HER in alkaline media. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Influence of doping level on the electrocatalytic properties for oxygen reduction reaction of N-doped reduced graphene oxide
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Reduced Graphene Oxide (rGO) doped with different nitrogen (N) concentrations (5, 10, and 15 parts in weight) were successfully synthesized via hydrothermal conditions, from graphene oxide (GO) and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (amitrole) to obtain N-5-rGO, N-10-rGO, and N-15-rGO. These N-doped materials were characterized and evaluated for the first time as catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The physicochemical characteristics confirmed the simultaneous N-doping and reduction processes with a turbostratic re-stacking of graphene layers. Nitrogen was successfully introduced as a mix of pyridine-N, amine like-N, pyrrolic-N, and quaternary bonding species into the carbon lattice. The N content were 8.1, 9.9, and 10.5 at.% for N-5-rGO, N-10-rGO, and N-15-rGO. High catalytic activity was demonstrated in alkaline media with an onset potential of similar to 0.88 V and high current density (3.9 mA cm(-2)) for N-15-rGO, leading the ORR via the 4-electron transfer pathway. The results demonstrated that the amine like-N species enhance the ORR catalytic activity in addition to pyridinic and quaternary. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Effective charge separation towards enhanced photocatalytic activity via compositing reduced graphene oxide with two-phase anatase/brookite TiO2
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we synthesized composites consisting of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and two-phase anatase/brookite TiO2 particles. Results showed that with the addition of rGO to anatase/brookite TiO2, the photocatalytic H-2 production from aqueous methanol solution over Pt loaded catalyst is greatly enhanced. This is attributed to effective charge separation leading to the inhibition of photogenerated electron-hole recombination as evidenced from photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopic measurement. Moreover, with the rGO - anatase/brookite TiO2 composite, the H-2 production is 2.3 times the amount of H-2 produced by rGO - P25 TiO2 (which consists of anatase and ruffle particles) composite. The comparison illustrates the importance of the conduction band potential position. As the conduction band potential of brookite TiO2 is more cathodic than anatase and rutile TiO2, it is energetically more favorable for reductive hydrogen production. Through the concept of compositing rGO with two-phase semiconductor photocatalyst, our work has elucidated the importance of effective charge transfer as well as conduction band potential position in photocatalytic hydrogen generation.

AB  - In quantum dots sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs), the back-transport reaction, resulting from the recombination between the photo-generated electrons in transparent conductive oxide (TOC) substrates and the polysulfide species electrolytes, significantly impairs the power conversion efficiency. To solve this, a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) interface layer has been for the first time introduced between the TOC substrate and the porous TiO2 film in a modified CdS QDSSC by a spray-coating method. This rGO interface layer can effectively suppress the back-transport reaction by inhibiting the contact between TOC substrates and electrolytes. Consequently, an improvement in power conversion efficiency of ca. 20% has been achieved on the solar cell. Besides, an interesting threshold effect has also been found on this interface layer, which leads to much variated behavior of this rGO layer on the suppression of the back-transport reaction. Consequently, the optimum rGO interface layer has been obtained with a spray time of 2 min, which leads to the best photovoltaic properties. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We described a facile and eco-friendly method for preparation of Pd nanocomposites (Pd-PDDA/RGO), which possesses a low Pd metal percent (20 wt%) and a mean size of 3.9 nm. The reaction was carried out at room temperature using Pd nanoparticles anchored on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) with the assist of poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride). The Pd nanoparticles were well distributed without obvious aggregation. The Pd-PDDA/ RGO nanocomposites exhibit higher electrocatalytic activity and stability for the electrooxidation of ethanol than Pd/RGO, Pd-PDDA/MWCNTs (multi-walled carbon nanotubes) and Pd-PDDA/XC-72 carbon black. The peak current density for ethanol oxidation of PdPDDA/RGO is 1.38, 1.60 and 2.40 times stronger than that of Pd/RGO, Pd-PDDA/MWCNTs and Pd/XC-72, respectively.

TI  - Efficient visible-light-driven H-2 evolution induced by P-doped Cd1-xZnxS porous nano-spheres decorated with Ni2P and reduced graphene oxide
T2  - APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploiting visible-light-responsive photocatalysts for highly-efficient water-splitting is a very promising way to achieve the renewable hydrogen energy. To this end, the rational manipulation on the composition and structure of semiconductor nanomaterials appears extremely necessary. Herein, we construct a unique hybrid consisting of P-doped CZ(0.10)S-0.5P porous nano-spheres coupled with Ni2P and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) cocatalysts (CZ(0.10)S-0.5P@Ni2P/rGO), which exhibits an outstanding performance for H-2 evolution reaction (HER) under visible-light (lambda > 420 nm) irradiation. Noticeably, the CZ(0.10)S-0.5P@2Ni(2)P/1.5rGO with 2 wt%-Ni2P and 1.5 wt%-rGO delivers an exceptional HER rate of 616.8 mmol.h(-1.)g(-1) (the apparent quantum efficiency reaches 77.0% at 475 nm), outperforming that of Pt-loaded CZ(0.10)S-0.5P and the great majority of CdS-based composites reported previously. In addition, the CZ(0.10)S-0.5P@2Ni(2)P/1.5rGO composite also presents a steady H-2 generation activity under prolonged irradiation. The superior photocatalytic property of CZ(0.10)S-0.5P@Ni2P/rGO could be associated with the abundant active sites provided by Ni2P, excellent visible-light absorption, and effective charge transfer and separation enabled by the Schottky junctions formed between CZ(0.10)S-0.5P and Ni2P/rGO. The findings indicated here could promote the design and manufacture of advanced semiconductor nanostructures for sustainable energy applications.

TI  - Microwave-assisted in situ synthesis of cobalt nanoparticles decorated on reduced graphene oxide as promising electrodes for supercapacitors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A series of cobalt nanoparticles/reduced graphene oxide (Co/RGO) composites have been successfully synthesized via a facile microwave-assisted synthetic route for the first time. The synthesized composites are comprised of Co particles that are uniformly anchored onto the surface of graphene sheets by in situ reducing. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis are performed for systematically characterizing the microstructure and composition of the as-prepared Co/RGO composites. Interestingly, the as-prepared composites show superior electrochemical performance to their counterparts of Co and RGO as electrodes for supercapacitors. As a result, Co/RGO-15 composite exhibits a high specific capacitance of 370.7 F g(-1) at 5 mV s(-1) in 2 M KOH aqueous solution as well as good rate capability. The excellent electrochemical performances are due to the 3D graphene conductive network and the synergetic effect of RGO and Co particles. Meanwhile, the capacitance retention keeps about 92.3% of the initial value after 2000 cycles at a current density of 2 A g(-1), suggesting that such hybrid electrode possesses a great potential application in energy-storage devices.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - By means of co-electrodeposition, we fabricated 3D assembly of Pt nanostructures with dominant (100) plane on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) modified graphite electrode. The strong metal-support interaction at the atomic level makes the nanostructure highly durable and this modified electrode exhibited high electrocatalytic activity towards methanol oxidation. It has been found that the morphology, active site and the electrochemical activity of Pt are highly dependent on the substrate and the number of electrochemical cycling used for the deposition. rGO-Pt composite deposited using one cycle showed a high mass activity of 2.54 A/mg at 0.67 V for methanol oxidation in acidic condition and 1.84 A/mg at 0.03 V in alkaline medium. This simple and single step approach using electrodeposition to grow the morphology controlled Pt nanostructure on rGO, will aid in the development of active and stable catalyst for fuel cell applications.

The hybrid was characterized by XRD, EDX, FESEM and HRTEM. The electrochemical hydrogen evolution behavior of nanohybrids with different mass ratios was studied as modified glassy carbon electrodes by linear sweep voltammetry, chronopotentiometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results showed overpotential in 10 mA/cm(2) ( -100 mV) for Co5.57Fe1.62Ni1.81S8/rGO (1 g:0.5 g) among all nanohybrids. Also, the obtained Tafel slope (53.6 mV/dec) confirmed the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism for HER. The electro-catalytic properties for HER of Co5.57Fe1.62Ni1.81S8/rGO (1g:0.5 g) were compared with some transition metal dichalcogenide based composites.

AB  - In this work, gold nanoparticles decorated on reduced graphene oxide (Au/rGOs) samples were synthesized by employing the eco-friendly microwave-assisted process (MW). This rapid process has proven to be a viable and trustworthy new method for Au/rGOs preparation ensuring the simultaneous reduction of GO and obtaining of Au nanoparticles through a simple and facile one-step reaction in aqueous solution. The structure and morphology of prepared Au/rGOs were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, BET surface area. These analyses revealed good phase stability and distinct morphology. The as-prepared Au/rGO was involved in developing of a new membrane electrode assembly (MEA) and in-situ tested in long-time operation of PEMFC. The electrochemical stability of the innovative cathode was evaluated using an accelerated stress test (AST) - cycling potential protocol. The performed aggressive AST demonstrated excellent stability, thus we report an ORR electrocatalyst with enhanced durability. Moreover, this study extends the method applicability in respect to the preparation of other noble metal nanoparticles decorated on reduced graphene oxide. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

M3  - Article
AB  - The present study describes a novel and very sensitive electrochemical assay for determination of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) based on synergistic effects of reduced graphene oxide- magnetic iron oxide nanocomposite (rGO-Fe3O4) and celestine blue (CB) for electrochemical reduction of H2O2. rGO-Fe3O4 nanocomposite was synthesized and characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Chitosan (Chit) was used for immobilization of amino-terminated single-stranded DNA (ss-DNA) molecules via a glutaraldehyde (GA) to the surface of rGO-Fe3O4. The MTT (3-(4,5-Di hiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl etrazolium bromide) results confirmed the biocompatibility of nanocomposite. Experimental parameters affecting the ss-DNA molecules immobilization were optimized. Finally, by accumulation of the CB on the surface of the rGO-Fe3O4-Chit/ssDNA, very sensitive amperometric H2O2 sensor was fabricated. The electrocatalytic activity of the rGO-Fe3O4-Chit/DNA-CB electrode toward H2O2 reduction was found to be very efficient, yielding very low detection limit (DL) of 42 nM and a sensitivity of 8.51 A/M. Result shows that complex matrices of the human serum samples did not interfere with the fabricated sensor. The developed sensor provided significant advantages in terms of low detection limit, high stability and good reproducibility for detection of H2O2 in comparison with recently reported electrochemical H2O2 sensors.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Here, Pt-SrCoO3-delta was synthesized through a sol gel method and characterized with X-ray powder diffraction and scanning electron microscopy techniques. Graphene oxide was synthesized by a modified Hummers' method, then functionalized with 1, 1'-dimethyl-4, 4'-bipyridinium dichloride (methyl viologen) accompanied by Chitosan to prepare novel MV-RGO-CH. This was used as a support for nanoparticles to get Pt-SrCoO3-delta/MV-RGO-CH nanocomposite. Transmission electron microscopy image was used to show the morphology and distribution of nanoparticles. The electrocatalytic activity of Pt-SrCoO3-delta/MV-RGO-CH nanocomposite for ethanol electrooxidation was investigated by cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, COads stripping voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques. The effects of some experimental factors for ethanol oxidation on the prepared" nanocomposite were investigated and the optimum conditions were suggested. Pt-SrCoO3-delta/MV-RGO-CH nanocomposite showed higher catalytic activities than Pt/MV-RGO-CH for ethanol electrooxidation indicating that Pt-SrCoO3-delta/MV-RGO-CH nanocomposite could be a promising catalyst for direct ethanol fuel cells applications.

TI  - TiO2 nanofibers heterogeneously wrapped with reduced graphene oxide as efficient Pt electrocatalyst supports for methanol oxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The exploration of advanced catalyst supports is a promising route to obtain electrocatalysts with high activity and durability. Herein, TiO2 nanofibers heterogeneously wrapped with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) designated as h-rGO@TiO2-rGO were synthesized by a facile deposition and hydrothermal method and served as support for Pt nanoparticles (Pt NPs) used for methanol oxidation. The morphology and electrocatalytic properties of the catalysts were investigated by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and chronoamperometry. Pt NPs supported on h-rGO@TiO2-rGO showed uniform dispersion with a mean particle size of 3.4 nm. The electrocatalytic activity and stability of Pt/h-rGO@TiO2-rGO both improved remarkably compared with Pt/rGO and Pt/TiO2. This enhancement originated from the porous structure that promoted the homogeneous dispersion and enlarged the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of Pt NPs (ECSA(CO) = 30.95 m(2) g(-1)). Thus, the hrGO@TiO2-rGO hybrid could be developed as a promising electrocatalyst support material in fuel cells. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Soybean milk derived carbon intercalated with reduced graphene oxide as high efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploring high-performance and low-cost metal-free oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts from biomass-derived materials is vital to the development of novel energy conversion devices such as fuel cells, etc. Herein, nitrogen-enriched soybean milk derived carbon (BDC/rGO-HT-NH3) intercalated with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) electrocatalyst is prepared via one-pot hydrothermal synthesis method followed with nitridation by NH3. The resultant catalyst with high surface area, good conductivity and high content of N (9.4 at.%) shows high electrocatalytic activity towards ORR in alkaline medium, which mainly happens through the direct 4-electron pathway. The onset potential of BDC/rGO-HT-NH3 catalyzed ORR is 0.96 V vs RHE, which is only 0.11 V lower than that of the commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) catalyst. In addition, the BDC/rGO-HT-NH3 catalyst shows superior long-term running durability. The desirable catalytic performances enable the facile synthesis approach of BDC/rGO-HT-NH3 to be a promising methodology for transforming other biomass materials to N-enriched carbon based materials as low-cost and environmental friendly catalysts for ORR.

AB  - In this work, we developed a heterogeneous catalyst consisting of Al2O3 nanoparticle and low amounts of Pd that markedly enhances the hydrogen uptake of reduced graphene oxide (RGO). The Pd/Al2O3 hybrid particles were prepared by ultrasound-assisted impregnation of PdCl2 in aqueous suspension of Al2O3 nanoparticles. Hybrid particles were immobilized onto the RGO support, giving Pd/Al2O3 RGO nanocomposites. It was shown that incorporation of 1 wt% heterogeneous catalyst (<0.3 wt% Pd) significantly increased the hydrogen storage capacity of RGO from 0.17 wt% to 0.31 wt%. This indicated a raise of hydrogen uptake by factor of 1.8 in RGO nanocomposite. The improving hydrogen storage capacity of RGO nanocomposites by change of Al2O3 particle size and Pd content was linked to activation of processes usually grouped as spillover.

TI  - Highly selective hydrogen production from propane by Ru-Ni core-shell nanocatalyst deposited on reduced graphene oxide by sequential chemical vapor deposition
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A narrow temperature window (160 degrees C-190 degrees C) was identified for the selective deposition of Ru on Ni supported on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) through a sequential chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. Cyclopentadiene and cyclopentene were identified as decomposition products of nickelocene CVD on rGO, whereas only methane was detected in gaseous products from ruthenocene CVD. Heat treatment converted the selectively deposited Ru on Ni/rGO into Ru-Ni core-shell bimetallic system on the surface of rGO as confirmed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The Ru-Ni/rGO thus prepared produced hydrogen with high selectivity in propane steam reforming performed in the temperature range of 350 degrees C to 850 degrees C. Addition of 3.6% Ru against Ni supported on rGO improved the turnover frequency (TOF) of propane up to 70% to 100% compared to the Ni/rGO catalyst at lower temperatures (350 degrees C-450 degrees C). The presence of Ru lowered the activation energy of propane SR from 65.7 kJ mol(-1) for Ni/rGO to 48.7 kJ mol(-1) for Ru-Ni/rGO catalyst.

T2  - SURFACES AND INTERFACES
M3  - Article
AB  - A simple, cost-effective, ultrasound-assisted hydrothermal method was used to synthesize tungsten trioxide (WO3) and subsequently a tungsten trioxide/reduced graphene oxide (WO3/rGO) composite. The formation of the WO3/rGO composite was confirmed by XPS and Raman analyses. XPS analysis of the WO3/rGO composite revealed the presence of tungsten, carbon, and oxygen. Raman spectroscopy confirmed the presence of G and D bands in the WO3/rGO composite. The randomly arranged, interconnected, nanoplate-like morphology of WO3 was destroyed owing to the presence of rGO nanosheets and converted into a highly porous nanostructure. Multifunctional WO3 and WO3/rGO photocatalysts were used to study the sonocatalytic degradation of hazardous Congo red (CR) azo dye and photocatalytic hydrogen production. The surface area of the WO3/rGO composite (62.03 m(2)/g) was larger than that of WO3 (44.79 m(2)/g), thereby enhancing the efficiency of the sonocatalytic degradation and photocatalytic hydrogen production, which corresponds to the effective intercharge transfer between WO3 and rGO. Platinum was used as a co-catalyst with WO3/rGO to promote hydrogen production. The incorporation of rGO enhanced the CR dye degradation efficiency from 56 to 94% and the hydrogen production activity from 424.5 to 825.8 mu mol/h.g.

AB  - A novel method for the synthesis of non-noble metal based catalyst, copper-nickel-reduced graphene oxide (Cu@Ni/RGO) is established using two step methodology. First, the Ni/RGO nanocomposite was synthesized by the simultaneous reduction of Ni2+ ions and graphene oxide (GO) under reducing conditions, and after that Cu nanoparticles (Cu NPs) were encapsulated on them. We discuss the role of in-situ generated hydrogen radical (H-.) through spillover of H-2 on Ni/RGO which led the formation of crystalline Cu NPs, easily. The structure, composition and morphology of Cu@Ni/RGO nanocomposite were characterized by several related techniques. Further, we explored the practical application of non-noble metal based catalyst Cu@Ni/RGO for catalysis reaction due to its high catalytic performance towards reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) to 4-aminophenol (4-AP). It showed a remarkable high activity 90 s at room temperature (RT) with excellent stability up to 5 cycles. (C) 2015 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Fabrication of highly dispersed Pd nanoparticles supported on reduced graphene oxide for solid phase catalytic hydrogenation of 1,4-bis(phenylethynyl) benzene
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, nanopalladium catalysts supported on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (rGO/Pd) with different palladium loadings have been prepared by one-step reduction in aqueous phase. They were mixed with 1,4-bis(phenylethynyl)benzene (DEB) to form rGO/Pd-DEB composites according to a mass ratio of 1:3. It was shown that nanopalladium particles with particle size of about 2-6 nm were disperse uniformly on the surface of rGO when the Pd loadings were in the range of 3.97-10.60 wt%. The maximum hydrogen uptake capacity of rGO/Pd-DEB composites at 25 degrees C determined according to PCT method was about 182.5 ml/g after reacted with hydrogen for about 20 h, which was some lower than that of the common Pd/C-DEB pallet getter (216 ml/g) but significantly higher than alkynyl modified polyvinyl alcohol supported palladium hydrogen absorbing materials (0.32 ml/g), indicating that rGO/Pd could be used in solid phase catalytic hydrogenation due to the high dispersion of palladium nanoparticles and the physical proximity of rGO/Pd catalyst with DEB organic molecules. This provides a good potential technical way for perparing the moldable carbon aerogel hydrogen absorption materials. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the present work, we synthesized and systematically characterized two novel graphene-based nanomaterials, a chemically reduced graphene oxide (GO) sponge and a microwave-exfoliated GO. Textural properties were determined by N-2 adsorption/desorption at 77 K, while additional characterization techniques were employed, such as Micro-Raman Spectroscopy, Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy and High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy, to elucidate further the structural and morphological features. Both nanomaterials were additionally evaluated for their H-2 storage capacity and were critically compared to commercially available carbons (e.g. few-layer graphenes, carbon nanotubes) based on systematic H-2 adsorption/desorption measurements at 77 K between 0 and 1 bar. Maximum H-2 gravimetric capacities of similar to 0.5 wt% and similar to 0.7 wt% were recorded at 77K and 1 bar for the reduced GO sponge and the microwave-exfoliated GO, respectively.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY

AB  - This study presents a novel and highly efficient CeO2-based type of additives to improve the performance of PEM fuel cells. Cerium(IV) oxide (CeO2-based) nanorods and CeO2 nanorod decorated nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (NrGO) (CeO2/NrGO) were synthesized and utilized to enhance the ORR performance of PEMFCs. With a low energy transition between Ce thorn 3 to Ce thorn 4 and its high catalytic activity, CeO2 could promote O-2 reduction. The structural properties of CeO2 nanorods and the CeO2/NrGO composite were investigated using XRD, RAMAN, SEM, TEM, TGA, BET, and XPS. The synthesized CeO2 nanorods and CeO2/NrGO composite were mixed with a low platinum loading (0.09 mgPt.cm(-1)), and ex -situ electrochemical characterizations were performed (CV and LSV) to evaluate their catalytic activities. Fuel cell performance tests and in-situ impedance analyses were also conducted to confirm the electrochemical results. Compared to commercial Pt/C-based MEA (269 mW.cm(-2)), the addition of both CeO2 nanorods (382 mW.cm(-2)) and CeO2/NrGO (389 mW.cm(-2)) to the catalyst layer showed a significant enhancement in fuel cell performance, due to the unique oxygen buffer ability of the synthesized additives.

TI  - Functionalized rGO-Pd nanocomposites as high-performance catalysts for hydrogen generation via water electrolysis
T2  - ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
M3  - Article
AB  - Designing an efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is an important research area among the energy-related topics. In our study, the surface of the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) has been modified with reduced graphene oxide/(3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane/Schiff base (rGO/APTES/Scb) composite structure. Palladium (Pd), which is preferred due to its high catalytic activity in HER process, has been embedded on this composite surface by two different methods. The first nanocomposite was obtained by depositing Pd nano particles electrochemically on the rGO/APTES/Scb surface, referred to as rGO/APTES/Scb/Pd Nc1. The other nanocomposite was synthesized by complexing Pd2+ with GO/APTES/Scb and then electrochemically reduced after applied to the electrode surface to obtain rGO/APTES/Scb/Pd Nc2. Conventional characterization techniques have been used to determine the surface structure, morphology and the chemical composition of the as prepared nanocomposites. The results have shown the different distribution of Pd nanoparticles on both electrodes and that obtained from electrochemical tests for HER were also compatible in themselves. Although both nanocomposites showed high performance and stability, rGO/APTES/Scb/Pd Nc2 exhibited slightly better catalytic activity with an onset potential of -190 mV, a Tafel slope of 129 mV of per decade and achieving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of -148 mV.

AB  - A novel catalyst, palladium on nickel boride supported with reduced graphene oxide abbreviated as Pd@NixB/RGO nanocomposite was synthesized by a facile method. NixB and RGO were synthesized by a single step via the simultaneous reduction of graphene oxide (GO) and Ni2+ ions in presence of alkaline sodium borohydride (NaBH4, pH at 12.5). In the next step, Pd nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized on the surface of NixB/RGO in presence of anhydrous methanol (CH3OH) without using any specific reducing agents, which led the formation of small Pd NPs with homogeneous size distribution, suggesting the facile and green synthesis of the nanocomposite. The structure and morphology of Pd@NixB/RGO nanocomposite were characterized by several techniques. Cyclic voltammetric (CV) measurements of Pd@NixB/RGO nanocomposite towards ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) show their promising electrocatalytic behaviour. CV shows the high current density which was modified and increased upon cycling after 50 cycle, which indicates the high catalytic activity and CO tolerance capability when compared to the unsupported Pd@NixB NPs. Further, chronoamperometric (CA) measurements show the higher stability of the Pd@NixB/RGO nanocomposite compare to the Pd@NixB NPs. (C) 2015 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

M3  - Article
AB  - Glassy carbon electrode (GCE) modified by reduced graphene oxide Cu-Pd nano-dendrimer (Pd-CuNDs-RGO/GCE) was prepared using electro-deposition and spontaneous displacement methods. Graphene oxide was put on the surface of GCE by drop-casting, then a thin film of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) was formed by electro-reduction at similar to 0.9 V. The copper nano-dendrimers (CuNDs) were electro-plated on RGO/GCE surface. Finally, Pd-CuNDs-RGO/GCE was prepared by the spontaneous replacement of CuNDs with palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs) in a dilute solution of palladium. The electrode surface was characterized using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray energy diffraction (EDX) spectroscopy, and electrochemical techniques. The electrochemical behavior of the modified electrode in the oxidation of alkaline solution of methanol was investigated. The experimental conditions affecting the performance of the modified electrode in the methanol oxidation were studied and optimized. Finally, the proposed electrode has the onset potential of similar to 0.5 V and the ratio of i(f)/i(b) equal to 2.2, which confirms the high catalytic activity. The electrode has appropriate stability and shows about 86% of initial activity after 100 times testing. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Highly dispersed MnO nanoparticles supported on N-doped rGO as an efficient oxygen reduction electrocatalyst via high-temperature pyrolysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Transition metal-based compounds, due to their excellent ORR catalytic performance under alkaline condition, have recently emerged as one of the most promising alternatives to noble metal-based ORR catalysts. It is worth noting that manganese oxide can take an unique advantage for decomposition of intermediate adsorption products H2O2 and can effectively reduce O-2 to OH-. However, most research has focused on MnO2, while attention has rarely been paid to MnO catalysts. In addition, under high-temperature pyrolysis condition, MnO is the most stable manganese oxide but MnO nanoparticles easily agglomerate. Hence, it is very difficult to obtain well-dispersed and small-sized MnO nanoparticles. Herein, on the basis of pre-synthesizing uniformly distributed manganese complexes on the reduced graphene oxide (rGO), we innovatively prepare highly dispersed and small-sized MnO nanoparticles (-3.94 nm) via high-temperature pyrolysis, which are uniformly anchored on N-doped reduced graphene oxide (NrGO) as an efficient oxygen reduction electrocatalyst. The as-obtained MnO/NrGO (1050 degrees C) electrocatalyst achieves satisfactory onset potential (0.942 V) and half-wave potential (0.820 V) under alkaline condition. And the limiting current density is 4.17 mA cm(-2), which is very close to that of Pt/C (20 wt%, JM). Meanwhile, MnO/NrGO (1050 degrees C) catalyst presents superior longstanding durability and methanol resistance than Pt/C (JM). This work indicates that high temperature pyrolysis can improve the purity of manganese oxide, simultaneously the defects of NrGO can reduce particle size of MnO nanoparticles, which are greatly beneficial to improve ORR performance. This work provides a new idea for research of MnO catalysts for ORR in the future. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) supported g-C3N4-TiO2 ternary hybrid layered photocatalyst was prepared via ultrasound assisted simple wet impregnation method with different mass ratios of g-C3N4 to TiO2. The synthesized composite was investigated by various characterization techniques, such as XRD, FTIR, Raman Spectra, FE-SEM, HR-TEM, UV-vis DRS Spectra, XPS Spectra and PL Spectra. The optical band gap of g-C3N4-TiO2/rGO nano composite was found to be red shifted to 2.56 eV from 2.70 eV for bare g-C3N4. It was found that g-C3N4 and TiO2 in a mass ratio of 70:30 in the g-C3N4-TiO2/rGO nanocomposite, exhibits the highest hydrogen production activity of 23,143 mu mol g(-1)h(-1) through photo catalytic water splitting. The observed hydrogen production rate from glycerol-water mixture using g-C3N4-TiO2/rGO was found to be 78 and 2.5 times higher than g-C3N4 (296 mu mol g(-1)h(-1) and TiO2 (11,954 mu mol g(-1)h(-1)), respectively. A direct contact between TiO2 and rGO in the g-C3N4-TiO2/rGO nanocomposite produces an additional 10,500 mu mol g(-1)h(-1) of hydrogen in 4 h of photocatalytic reaction than the direct contact between g-C3N4 and rGO. The enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of the resultant nanocomposite can be ascribed to the increased visible light absorption and an effective separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs at the interface of g-C3N4-TiO2/rGO nanocomposite. The effective separation and transportation of photogenerated charge carriers in the presence of rGO sheet was further confirmed by a significant quenching of photoluminescence intensity of the g-C3N4-TiO2/rGO nanocomposite. The photocatalytic hydrogen production rate reported in this work is significantly higher than the previously reported work on g-C3N4 and TiO2 based photocatalysts.

TI  - Synthesis of reduced graphene oxide wrapped-copper sulfide hollow spheres as electrode material for supercapacitor
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Copper sulfide (CuS) is a promising candidate for the electrode material in supercapacitor due to its metal-like electronic conductivity and high theoretical capacity. However, volume change during cycling causes poor cycling stability and improving cycle life is a major research challenge. Herein, we present a strategy by fabricating reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-wrapped CuS hollow spheres using a simple solvothermal route assisted by ethylene glycol to improve the electrochemical performance of CuS in supercapacitors. The asprepared samples are well characterized by utilizing Scan electron microscope, Transmission electron microscope, powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectrum and Raman spectra techniques. It is demonstrated that the obtained CuS/rGO composite shows excellent electrochemical performance as electrode material for supercapacitors. The CuS/rGO electrode displays a significantly enhanced specific capacitance of 2317.8 F g(-1) and an excellent cycling stability of 96.2% retention after 1200 cycles at a current density of 1.0 A g(-1). The likely cause is the synergetic effects between the hollow spherical structure and the high conductivity of rGO. More importantly, the present synthesis strategy may be readily extended to the preparation of other composites based on CuS with tailored morphologies and surface textures for potential applications in energy storage and conversion devices.

TI  - Covalent functionalization of graphene with 1,5-diaminonaphthalene and ultrasmall palladium nanoparticles for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1,5-diaminonaphthalene and ultrasmall palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs) embedded electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (denoted as ERGO-DAN-Pd) was successfully synthesized and employed as a cathode catalyst for enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in direct alkaline fuel cells (DAFCs). The physical properties of ERGO-DAN-Pd were investigated using several instrumental methods. The morphological characterizations demonstrate that the ultrasmall PdNPs were homogeneously dispersed on the ERGO-DAN film. X-ray analysis confirmed the successful covalent functionalization of graphene sheets with DAN. The electrocatalytic activity of ERGO-DAN-Pd towards ORR was excellent compared to other electrodes in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. Particularly, it showed 1.8 and 2.7 magnitude higher mass activity with large specific activity compared to 20 wt.% Pt/C and nonfunctionalized ERGO/Pd, respectively. Moreover, the reaction kinetic parameters confirmed that the ORR at ERGO-DAN-Pd catalyst was followed by a 4e(-) process with faster electron transfer rate per O-2 with better stability and fuel selectivity than state-of-the-are Pt/C for DAFCs application.

TI  - Flexible carbon nanotubes-MnO2/reduced graphene oxide-polyvinylidene fluoride films for supercapacitor electrodes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) added into polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) films have been used as substrates for successive electrodeposition of MnO2 and carbon nanotube (CNT) layers, forming flexible CNTs-MnO2/rGO-PVDF hybrid films that are suitable for use as supercapacitor electrodes. The hybrid films maintained the high conductivity of rGO nanosheets, high surface-to-volume ratio of CNTs, and large pseudo-capacitance of MnO2 nanosheets, and demonstrated their potential in all-solid-flexible supercapacitors by significantly improving the capacitive behavior of the supercapacitor when assembled into supercapacitor devices. Asymmetric supercapacitors comprised of the CNTs-MnO2/graphene-PVDF hybrid film electrode, Pt sheet electrode, and a 6 M NaOH electrolyte exhibited a working voltage as high as 1.8 V and a high energy density of 49.1 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 4.83 kW kg(-1). Moreover, the supercapacitors exhibited a specific capacitance of 276.3 F g(-1) at a discharge current density of 0.08 A g(-1). Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, reduced graphene was decorated with thionine to synthesize Th/rGO nanocomposite via diazonium reaction. The nanocomposite was identified using several techniques including SEM, EDX, XRD, XPS, and IR techniques. The behavior of the nano composite, as a supercapacitor electrode, was examined using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results obtained demonstrated that the nanocomposite has an excellent specific capacitance of 1255 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g. Furthermore, the stability of the electrode was examined after 5000 cycles. The results showed that 93% of the initial capacity appears after 5000 cycles. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Nanocomposite of BiPO4 and reduced graphene oxide as an efficient photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nanocomposites of BiPO4 and reduced graphene oxide (BiPO4/RGO) synthesized by hydrothermal method, hydrazine reduction, and UV-assisted photoreduction method were studied as photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution from ethanol aqueous solution under irradiation. The incorporation of RGO into BiPO4 significantly enhanced the photocatalytic activity for H-2 evolution, and the photocatalytic activity increases in the order of BiPO4/RGO-hydrothermal > BiPO4/RGO-photoreduction > BiPO4/RGO-hydrazine. The optimum proportion of GO is 2 wt% for all the samples prepared by different methods. The rate of H2 production calculated for BiPO4/RGO-hydrothermal (with 2 wt% GO) nanocomposite was about 306 mu mol/h/g, which was almost 2 times as high as that for bare BiPO4. The XRD, Raman and XPS characterization suggested that the original GO was successfully reduced to RGO. The more intimate contact between BiPO4 and RGO, the higher photocurrent responses and the higher reduction degree of RGO was consistent with the higher photocatalytic performance.

TI  - Enhanced electrochemical and hydrogen storage properties of La-Mg-Ni-based alloy electrode using a Ni and N co-doped reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite as a catalyst
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To enhance the electrochemical property of a La0.7Mg0.3(Ni0.9Co0.1)(3.5) alloy, a three-dimensional (3D) reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-supported nickel and nitrogen co-doped (Ni-N@rGO) nanocomposite is fabricated by an impregnation method and introduced into the La0.7Mg0.3(Ni0.9Co0.1)(3.5) alloy. The results show that the reversible hydrogen storage property and the comprehensive electrochemical performance of the La0.7Mg0.3(Ni0.9Co0.1)(3.5) alloy are enhanced effectively when it is modified by the Ni-N@rGO nanocomposite. The high-rate dischargeability values at a discharge current density of 1500 mA g(-1) for the La0.7Mg0.3(Ni0.9Co0.1)(3.5) alloy and Ni-N@rGO-modified samples are 0.0% and 70.5%, respectively. Additionally, the anodic peak currents for the unmodified alloy electrode is 892 mA g(-1). Under the catalytic action of the Ni-N@rGO nanocomposite, the value increases to 2307 mA g(-1), which is 2.59 times larger than that of unmodified samples. The results also indicate that the diffusion ability of the hydrogen atom in the alloy electrode body enhances significantly when modified by the Ni-N@rGO nanocomposite. The hydrogen diffusion coefficient for the La0.7Mg0.3(Ni0.9Co0.1)(3.5) alloy electrode increases from 3.93 x 10(-10) cm(2) s(-1) to 6.15 x 10(-10) cm(2) s(-1) when is modified by Ni-N@rGO nanocomposite. These improvements in the comprehensive electrochemical properties are mainly attributed to the excellent electrochemical activity and conductivity of the Ni-N@rGO nanocomposite.

TI  - Highly efficient and durable phosphine reduced iron-doped tungsten oxide/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites for the hydrogen evolution reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The design and development of inexpensive and highly efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen production from water splitting are highly crucial for green energy and the hydrogen economy. Herein, we report phosphine reduced an iron-doped tungsten oxide nanoplate/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite (Fe-WOxP/rGO) as an excellent electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction. This electrocatalyst was synthesized using a hydrothermal method, followed by reduction with phosphine (PH3), which was generated from sodium hypophosphite. The catalyst onset potential, Tafel slope, and stability were investigated. Accordingly, Fe-WOxP/rGO exhibited impressively high electrocatalytic activity with a low overpotential of 54.60 mV, which is required to achieve a current density of 10 mAcm(-2). The Tafel slope of 41.99 mV dec(-l) and the linear sweep voltammetry curve is almost the same as 2000 cycles and electrolysis under static overpotential (54.60 mV) is remain for more than 24 h in 0.5 M H2SO4. The catalytic activity and conductivity of FeWOxP/rGO were higher than WOxP, Fe-WOxP and WOxP/rGO. Such an outstanding performance of the Fe-WOxP/rGO nanocomposite is attributed to the coupled synergic effect between high oxygen vacancies formation on tungsten oxide in the nanoplate-like structure of Fe-WOxP and rGO nanosheet, making it as an excellent electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction.

TI  - Synergistic effect of ascorbic acid on the synthesis of mesoporous rGO-MoS2(100) nanocomposites and promotion of hydrogen evolution reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We report a new method for the preparation of MoS2 (100)-reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposites for enhancement of HER. Ascorbic acid synergistically is applied to reduce graphene oxide and controls the sulfur content of MoS2 resulted in texturing of MoS2 (100) by up taking sulfur and proposing Mo(VI) oxidation state. Variety of characterization were performed to support this hypothesis including XRD, FESEM, TEM, EDX elemental mapping, XPS, Raman, FT-IR and UV-Vis spectroscopies, TGA and BET-BJH analyses. By incorporating ascorbic acid in the synthesis process, the atomic ratio of S/Mo is 0.02 for rGO-Mo(VI)S-2 hybrid structure with quenched (002) Bragg diffraction peak. rGO-MoS2 shows a net 0.08 mA cm(-2) polarized photocurrent in light off-on measurement. A Tafel slope of 44 mV.dec(-1), an exchange current of 0.62 mA cm(-2), over potential of 156 mV 10 mA cm(-2) and onset potential of 25 mV was obtained. This report opens a new pass way in simple and cheap preparation of controlled defective MoS2-rGO structures with new crystal growth (100) of MoS2 for enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Reaction using ascorbic acid. Mechanisms for the role of ascorbic acid on the formation of such defective structure as well as the process of enhancement of HER have been suggested. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focused on the large band gap of TiO2 for its use as a photocatalyst under light emitting diode (LED) light irradiation. The photocatalytic activities of core-shell structured Au@TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs), nitrogen doped Au@TiO2 NPs, and Au@TiO2/rGO nanocomposites (NCs) were investigated under various light intensities and sacrificial reagents. All the materials showed better photocatalytic activity under white LED light irradiation than under blue LED light. The N-doped core-shell structured Au@TiO2 NPs (Au@N-TiO2) and Au@TiO2/rGO NCs showed enhanced photocatalytic activity with an average H-2 evolution rate of 9205 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) and 9815 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), respectively. All these materials showed an increasing rate of hydrogen evolution with increasing light intensity and catalyst loading. In addition, methanol was more suitable as a sacrificial reagent than lactic acid. The rate of hydrogen evolution increased with increasing methanol concentration up to 25% in DI water and decreased at higher concentrations. Overall, Au@TiO2 core-shell-based nanocomposites can be used as an improved photocatalyst in photocatalytic hydrogen production. (C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

M3  - Article
AB  - Novel Ag2CrO4/GO/MnFe2O4 photocatalysts synthesized by precipitation method and fabricated on indium tin oxide surface by electrophoretic deposition technique. The obtained Ag2CrO4/GO/MnFe2O4 composite has been verified by microscopic study, chemical and structural analyses. Also, the ternary composite showed higher photocurrent response and weaker photoluminescence spectrum than MnFe2O4, GO, Ag2CrO4 and GO/MnFe2O4. Photo-cathodes prepared using semiconductor photocatalyst powders were investigated for visible-light-driven photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution. The best result of the photoelectrochemical hydrogen production in the presence of Ag2CrO4/GO/MnFe2O4 composite was determined as 446.93 mu mol.cm(-2) in 90 min under visible light illumination. So, the enhanced hydrogen producing over the ternary composite was obtained. This study presents the development of stable visible light active photocatalytic materials and the design of efficient for the advancement of hydrogen production via photoelectrochemical water splitting in the future.

TI  - Noble metal-free cuprous oxide/reduced graphene oxide for enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water reduction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cu2O loaded reduced graphene oxide (Cu2O/RGO) was prepared via a one-step in-situ reduction method. Composition and structure of the Cu2O/RGO were characterized by X-ray diffraction, high resolution transmission electron microscope and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. With eosin Y (EY) and rose bengal (RB) as co-sensitizers, the activity of hydrogen evolution over the Cu2O/RGO dramatically increased and achieved a maximum when the loading amount of Cu on the RGO was about 3 wt.%. It exceeded that of RGO and Cu2O by a factor of 7.3 and 4.2 at the same conditions, respectively. It could be even comparable to that of the Pt/RGO under the same reaction conditions. This work showed a possibility of utilizing Cu2O as an alternative for noble metals (such as Pt) due to its low cost and high performance in photocatalytic hydrogen production.

TI  - CeO2 nanoparticle-decorated reduced graphene oxide as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are essential for the development of renewable energy technologies such as fuel cells and metal-air batteries. Herein, a ceria (CeO2) modified reduced graphene oxide (CeO2/rGO) nanocomposite was fabricated via a facile yet costeffective method under a mild condition. The prepared CeO2/rGO nanocomposite showed remarkable catalytic activity, high tolerance to methanol and durability toward ORR in alkaline media. Meanwhile, the catalyst also displayed remarkable activity for the OER with more negative onset potential and higher current compared with commercial Pt/ C catalyst. The high oxygen reaction activity of the catalyst could contribute to synergistic effect of the combination of the oxygen vacancies of CeO2 and excellent electronic conductivity of rGO. The results suggested that the CeO2/rGO nanocomposite has potential advantages as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in the practical applications. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Fabrication of Non-Enzymatic Electrochemical Hydrogen Peroxide Sensor Based on Ag NPs/Co3O4/ERGO Composite
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-enzymatic hydrogen peroxide sensor was constructed and designed by electrodeposition of silver nanoparticles on a modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) with an electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO) and cobalt oxide (Co3O4) film. The characterization of Ag NPs/Co3O4/ERGO/GCE was carried out by scanning electron microscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and chronoamperometry. The result of scanning electron microscopy demonstrated Ag NPs were dispersed on the Co3O4/ERGO composite. Electrochemical measurements revealed that the Ag NPs electrodeposition on the Co3O4 film provides an electrode with boosted current of reaction, sensitivity, and outstanding stability. The sensor displayed superior linearity in the concentration range of 50 mu M to 1.1 mM with a detection limit of 0.84 mu M (S/N=3) and showed high sensitivity (2950 mu A mM(-1) Cm-2).

TI  - Electrochemical layer-by-layer fabrication of a novel three-dimensional Pt/graphene/carbon fiber electrode and its improved catalytic performance for methanol electrooxidation in alkaline medium
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Here, we report a novel method for assembling reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and Pt nanoparticles on a carbon fiber (CF) electrode successively to form a stable Pt nanoparticle-RGO-Pt nanoparticle-RGO/CF multiple junction for electrocatalysis application. As the SEM imaging exhibited, Pt nanoparticles are uniformly deposited on the surface of each RGO sheet, performing an alternative covering structure of RGO and Pt nanoparticle multi-layer on the CF electrode. Thus, a novel three-dimensional (3D) multi-layered Pt/RGO modified CF electrode (N-Pt/RGO/CF) is obtained. Experimental results demonstrate that the prepared N-Pt/RGO/CF electrode shows good electrochemical properties and enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward methanol electrooxidation in alkaline medium as compared with the Pt/RGO/CF electrode without layer-by-layer structure or the Pt/CF electrode without RGO. It is due to the unique 3D pore structure of N-Pt/RGO/CF and the good electron transport property of RGO in the composite electrode. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

TI  - Bimetallic PtPd nanoparticles relying on CoNiO2 and reduced graphene oxide as a most operative electrocatalyst toward ethanol fuel oxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Of late, fuel cells have drawn great attentions owing to high-energy demands, fossil fuel depletion and worldwide environmental pollution. Direct ethanol fuel cell (DEFC) constituted as one of the most promising sources of green energy, howbeit the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) sluggish kinetic is one of the essential challenges toward the commercialization of DEFCs. Herein, we introduce bimetallic catalyst on CoNiO2 modified reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to completely exploit the advantages of nano-surface structures as well as the reduction of Pt and Pd loading in fuel cells. With the combined advantages of PtPd, CoNiO2 and rGO, a significant enhancement in electrocatalytic behavior, stability and CO poisoning tolerance of PtPd have been observed. Regarding the implications, PtPd/ CoNiO2/rGO is greatly preferable than Pt/CoNiO2/rGO and Pd/CoNiO2/rGO in terms of high electroactive surface area (ECSA), electro-catalytic activity, and lower onset potential (Eons) towards the EtOH oxidation in alkaline media. Furthermore, the chronoamperometry curve (CA) illustrated 77% after 3600 s which is dramatically soared compared with the other electrodes (<= 40%), demonstrating the high stability of the PtPd bimetallic nanoparticle electrocatalyst. Ultimately, PtPd/CoNiO2/rGO nanocomposite is found to be an excellent anode electrocatalyst for application in DEFCs. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Graphene functionalization with metallic Pt nanoparticles: A path to cost-efficient H-2 production in microbial electrolysis cells
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Platinum is one of the most widely used catalysts in the cathode of Microbial Electrolysis Cells (MECs) to overcome the relatively slow kinetics of hydrogen evolution, even though it is not economically feasible on a large scale. This work aims at developing, applying, characterizing, and optimizing two novel Pt-functionalized inks with promising charac-teristics: Pt@rGO based on reduced graphene oxide and Pt@Graphitene based on a home-made material named Graphitene, which showed improved performance at a lower cost. The Pt-functionalized materials were deposited on carbon cloth and used as cathode electrode in a single chamber MEC. These materials provided 47% increase in Pt func-tionalization over commercial inks. Moreover, surface areas of 10.76 m(2)/g and 24.40 m(2)/g and electroactive areas of 0.10 cm(2)/cm(2) and 0.16 cm(2)/cm(2) were determined for Pt@Graphitene and Pt@rGO, respectively, a difference caused by structural defects in the case of the Pt@rGO, which slightly improved its performance compared to Pt@Graphitene. Thus, the experimental results reached ca. 0.8 mA/cm(2), a 43% higher intensity than that obtained using conventional commercial inks. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - The decoration of TiO2/reduced graphene oxide by Pd and Pt nanoparticles for hydrogen gas sensing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Reduced graphene oxide (RGO) was used to improve the hydrogen sensing properties of Pd and Pt-decorated TiO2 nanoparticles by facile production routes. The TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized by sol-gel method and coupled on GO sheets via a photoreduction process. The Pd or Pt nanoparticles were decorated on the TiO2/RGO hybrid structures by chemical reduction. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrated that GO reduction is done by the TiO2 nanoparticles and Ti-C bonds are formed between the TiO2 and the RGO sheets as well. Gas sensing was studied with different concentrations of hydrogen ranging from 100 to 10,000 ppm at various temperatures. High sensitivity (92%) and fast response time (less than 20 s) at 500 ppm of hydrogen were observed for the sample with low concentration of Pd (2 wt.%) decorated on the TiO2/RGO sample at a relatively low temperature (180 degrees C). The RGO sheets, by playing scaffold role in these hybrid structures, provide new pathways for gas diffusion and preferential channels for electrical current. Based on the proposed mechanisms, Pd/TiO2/RGO sample indicated better sensing performance compared to the Pt/TiO2/RGO. Greater rate of spill-over effect and dissociation of hydrogen molecules on Pd are considered as possible causes of the enhanced sensitivity in Pd/TiO2/RGO.

TI  - Plasmon-enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production by dual dye sensitized ternary composite of MoS3/Au core-Ag shell nanoparticles/graphene
T2  - JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Herein, the ternary composite consisting of MoS3, Au core-Ag shell nanoparticles (Au@AgNP), and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is synthesized for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. The various characterization studies reveal the co-existence of amorphous MoS3 nanoflakes and the Au@AgNP with the dual absorptions of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) in rGO nanosheets. With the help of single dye sensitization, the ternary composite exhibits a better photocatalytic activity of 9.6 mmol h(-1) g(-1) with the apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 7.8% and excellent long-term stability under visible light illumination. It also shows the wavelengthdependent photocatalytic activity under the different monochromatic light radiation. Interestingly, the photocatalytic performance of ternary composite further enhances when dual dyes are utilized for sensitization. The optimized photocatalytic reaction system shows a maximum H-2 production rate of 10.6 mmol h(-1)g(-1) with the AQY of 8.6%. The higher activity of ternary photocatalysts is attributed to the amorphous MoS3 nanoflakes with the exposed reactive sites over the conductive rGO nanosheets, which promotes the electron transfer from photoexcited dyes to MoS3. More importantly, the extended SPR absorption of Au@AgNP in-line with the maximum absorption of dye molecules improves light-harvesting ability and efficiently stimulates the dye excitation.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 1st International Conference on Nanotechnology, Nanomaterials and Thin Films for Energy Applications (Nano Energy)
CL  - Univ Coll London, London, ENGLAND
AB  - We report nanostructured composites based on single crystal hematite (Fe2O3), reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), which were synthesized via the hydrothermal method. The Fe2O3/MWCNT/RGO composite exhibits enhanced photocatalytic activity in terms of the degradation of Rhodamine B under visible irradiation compared with Fe2O3, or the Fe2O3/MWCNT or Fe2O3/RGO composites. The Fe2O3 and composite samples were analyzed using X-ray diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller theory, and ultraviolet visible spectrophotometry. From these analyses, we find that a uniform distribution of MWCNTs and RGO sheets with Fe2O3 nanorhombohedra results in an increase in the specific surface area and optical absorbance, as well as a reduction in the charge carrier recombination rate, and favorable charge transport properties were observed using photoelectrochemical measurements. This synthesis method represents a technique for fabrication of composite materials with low cost, and that are suitable for photocatalysis, with potential applications in water purification.

TI  - A hydrothermal route for constructing reduced graphene oxide/TiO2 nanocomposites: Enhanced photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A series of reduced graphene oxide/TiO2 (RGO/TiO2) nanowire microsphere composites were synthesized with a facile one-step hydrothermal method using TiCl3 and graphene oxide (GO) as the starting materials, during which the formation of TiO2 and the reduction of GO occur simultaneously. The obtained nanocomposites were characterized with X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, respectively. UV-vis absorption spectra showed that the absorption edges of TiO2 were extended into visible light region with the addition of RGO. The photocatalytic activities of the samples with and without Pt as cocatalysts were evaluated by hydrogen evolution from water photo-splitting under UV-vis light illumination. Enhanced photocatalytic properties were observed for the as-prepared RGO/TiO2 nanocomposites. The amount of hydrogen evolution from the optimized photocatalyst reached to 43.8 mu mol h(-1), which was about 1.6 times as high as that of bare TiO2. The results shown here indicate a convenient and applicable approach to further exploitation of high activity materials for photocatalytic water splitting applications.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - We report on the construction of PdAg/reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-based electrochemical H2O2 sensors by exploiting the high surface area and fast electron transfer rate of rGO, as well as the high electrocatalytic activity of palladium-silver nanoparticles. The nanocomposites were prepared via a one-step reduction method and characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The performance of the sensors was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry methods. The SEM images showed that the constructed nanocomposites had three-dimensional structure (3D), which both provided large specific surface area for the electrochemical reactions and enhanced the transports of the analyte on the sensors surface. The PdAg/rGO sensors had a high sensitivity of 247.6 +/- 2.7 mu A . mM(-1) . cm(-2) and the 3D structure of rGO along with the high electrocatalytic activity of PdAg nanoparticles allowed the detection of H2O2 in a wide concentration range from 0.05 mM to 28 mM. To evaluate the selectivity of the sensors, the analytical response toward the exposure of H2O2, ascorbic acid, uric acid, and glucose were measured. The practical applicability of PdAg/rGO-based sensor design was studied in human serum. (C) 2016 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - TiO2 nanosheets with high ratio of {001} facets were coupled with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets through the link of silver (Ag) nanoparticles, forming a novel ternary nanocomposite photocatalyst with a vertical heterostructure, TiO2-Ag-rGO. The vertical anchoring of TiO2-Ag nanosheets between rGO sheets was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Due to excellent separation of electron hole pairs in the TiO2 nanosheets, enhanced electron transfer to rGO via Ag nanoparticles, the TiO2-Ag-rGO nanocomposite exhibited an outstanding performance in photocatalytic hydrogen production, with a hydrogen production rate of 593.56 Amol g(-1) h(-1).

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study deal with the fabrication of low cost nanocomposite based electrodes based on Nickel foam binder free substrate for supercapacitor applications. The composition of nanocomposite is molybdenum sulphide nanoparticle/graphene coated on mesoporous manganese oxide. The first step is to involve the preparation of mesoporous manganese oxide by non-ionic surfactant assisted method. In the second stage is to deposit the reduced graphene on mesoporous manganese oxide in the presence of ultrasonic irradiation followed by addition of known quantity of commercial MoS2 nanopowder (particle size below 90 nm). The manganese oxide based nanocomposite is showing porous architecture with graphene sheet formation together with MoS2 nanoparticle deposition. N-2 adsorption-desorption Isotherm curves for MoS2 nanoparticle (NP) modified graphene oxide/meso-MnO2 and pure meso-MnO2 displayed type IV isotherm with improved surface area values. The reduced graphene oxide (graphene) and MoS2 exist in the form of glassy flaky morphology as well as tubular/needle shapes are obtained after the deposition process in the final nanocomposite. The orderly arranged and anchored nano-sized mesoporous manganese oxide nanocomposites are showed increased specific capacitance (up to 527, 727 and 1160 F/g) and continuous cyclic stability.

AB  - RhP nanoparticles supported on reduced graphene oxide (RhP/rGO) synthesized by using a simple one-step wet-chemical approach have been investigated as superior catalysts toward dehydrogenation of hydrous hydrazine for chemical hydrogen storage. These RhP/rGO catalysts with different contents of P doping were characterized by ICP-AES, XRD, XPS, TEM, and STEM-HAADF. Thanks to the synergistic effect of phosphorous-doping, the obtained Rh92.6P7.4/rGO hybrid exhibits 100% H-2 selectivity, superior stability, and excellent catalytic performance with turnover frequency value (TOF) of 843.9 h(-1) toward hydrogen generation from alkaline solution of hydrazine at 323 K.

CP  - 15th Asian Conference on Solid State Ionics (SSI)
CL  - IIT Patna, Patna, INDIA
AB  - Addition of 2D GO to the TiO2 nanowires brings about progressive changes in the optical properties and photochemical hydrogen production. The composition with progressive addition of GO played a dramatic role in making the material blue shift. The blue shift may happen due to transition from O2- anti-bonding orbital to the Ti4+ lowest empty orbital and also the process of band shifting towards lower wavelength is attributed to quantum confinement effect which occurs due to the transformation of bulk titanate to nanostructure titanate. In this article, we present the results of TiO2 nanowires and its rGO composites. TiO2 with 30 mg rGO nanocomposite exhibits good UV-light induced hydrogen production unlike bare TiO2. Current studies explain how rGO addition can be employed for better hydrogen production.

TI  - Cost-effective Co3O4 nanospheres on nitrogen-doped graphene used as highly efficient catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing low-cost, efficient and stable catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction is meaningful and necessary for the industrialization of fuel cells. In this work, we report the controllable synthesis of Co3O4 nanospheres uniformly anchored on N-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) sheets with significant catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction via a simple two-step approach. Results show that there is an interaction between Co3O4 nanospheres and N-rGO after riveting on N-rGO, which is beneficial to the electron transfer between them. The Co3O4 NS/N-rGO hybrid has excellent catalytic activity, comparable to commercial Pt/C catalyst. The transferred electron number of the oxygen reduction reaction on Co3O4 NS/N-rGO is around 3.95. The hybrid has more excellent durability and methanol resistance than commercial Pt/C. The Co3O4 NS/N-rGO catalyst in our work provides a cost-effective the oxygen reduction reaction catalyst alternative to the precious metal Pt in fuel cell. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB  - Reduced graphene oxide supported CuFe2O4-TiO2 p-n heterojunction nanocomposite was prepared via ultrasound assisted simple wet impregnation method. The nanocomposites were characterized, by XRD, FTIR, Raman Spectra, FE-SEM, HR-TEM, UV-vis, DRS Spectra, and PL Spectra. The optical band gap of rGO/CuFe2O4-TiO2 nanocomposite was found to be red shifted to 1.51 eV from 3.20 eV for pristine TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs). The photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared rGO/CuFe2O4-TiO2 nanocomposite was determined via photocatalytic water-splitting in the presence of glycerol as hole scavenger under UV-vis light irradiation. A peak hydrogen production rate of 35981 mu molg(-1) h(-1) was obtained, which is similar to 8 and 3 times higher than that of bare TiO2 (4640 mu molg(-1) h(-1)) and CuFe2O4-TiO2 photocatalysts (14719 mu molg(-1) h(-1)), respectively. This remarkable improvement in the photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the enhanced visible light absorption and efficient charge carrier separation at the interface of rGO/CuFe2O4-TiO2 nanocomposites. A significant quenching of photoluminescence intensity of the rGO/CuFe2O4-TiO2 nanocomposite further confirmed the effective separation and transportation of photogenerated charge carriers in the presence of rGO sheet. A double charge separation and transportation mechanism is proposed for the enhanced photocatalytic activity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Synthesis of supported Pt nanoparticles by sonication for ORR: Effect of the graphene oxide-carbon composite
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Pt supported on graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (RGO), carbon Vulcan (C) and GO-C composite were prepared by using sonication as a simple synthesis method in the absence of any special capping agent or thermal treatment. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques were used to characterize the materials synthesized. The electrocatalysts synthesized were evaluated for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acid medium by using cyclic and linear voltammetry tests. The characterization results indicated that the highest dispersion of small Pt particles was observed on the samples supported on GO materials compared to carbon Vulcan due to the oxygen functional surface groups, which promoted a homogeneous distribution of Pt nanoparticles. The electrochemical characterization indicated that Pt/GO-C composite exhibited a 50% more specific and mass activity at 0.85 V for ORR than the conventional Pt/C catalysts, which is associated to Pt-support interaction that modifies the electronic properties of Pt for electrochemical application in fuel cell. GO-C (1:1) can be a promising support for improving the electrochemical activity for ORR. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

M3  - Article
AB  - Developing highly efficient and stable supported bimetallic nanoparticles catalysts via a facile strategy is one of the most admirable methods for sustainable hydrogen production from borohydride hydrolysis. Herein, we developed a facile technology for rapidly and straightforwardly manufacturing Pt-Ni bimetallic nanoparticles (BNPs) supported by partially reduced graphene oxide (prGO) with excellent catalytic activity and outstanding durability for hydrogen production from KBH4 and NH3BH3 alkaline solution. The uniformly dispersed Pt-40-Ni-60 BNPs with a statistical size of around 2.6 nm exhibited a surprising catalytic activity of 23,460 mol-H-2.h(-1).mol-Pt-1 at 308 K, moreover, whose activity was high up to 80% of the first time even after 30 runs, demonstrating an outstanding stability. The apparent activation energy for dehydrogenation of KBH4 and NH3BH3 were respectively about 27.8 and 33.6 kJ/mol for the prepared Pt-40-Ni-60/prGO catalyst. The extraordinary catalytic activity of the Pt-40-Ni-60/prGO catalyst owing to the strong charge transfer effect between Pt-Ni BNPs and graphene.& nbsp;(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Preparation of highly efficient sunlight driven photodegradation of some organic pollutants and H-2 evolution over rGO/FeVO4 nanocomposites
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - FeVO4 and rGO/FeVO4 nanocomposites were synthesized by one-step hydrothermal method. The structural and morphological properties of the prepared samples were investigated by XRD, TEM, EDS, XPS, FTIR, Raman, UV-Vis DRS and PL techniques. XRD, XPS and Raman techniques displayed that graphene oxide (GO) was successfully reduced to reduced graphene oxide (rGO) under hydrothermal conditions. Also, the addition of rGO enhanced the visible light absorption, oxygen vacancies, phase transformation of FeVO4 from triclinic to monoclinic phase at high amount of rGO and reduced the band gap energy of FeVO4. The photoactivity of the synthesis catalysts was investigated for the photo-degradation of Malachite green, phenol, Methylene blue and Rhodamine B under natural sunlight. Also, the catalysts were applied in H-2 evolution from water splitting. The results showed that, the rGO amount was proven to be a crucial factor affecting the structural properties and photocatalytic performance of FeVO4. The mineralization (TOC), photo-degradation mechanism and photocatalytic reaction kinetics were discussed. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Enhanced hydrogen storage in sandwich-structured rGO/Co1-xS/rGO hybrid papers through hydrogen spillover
T2  - JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) based two-dimensional (2D) structures have been fabricated for electrochemical hydrogen storage. However, the effective transfer of atomic hydrogen to adjacent rGO surfaces is suppressed by binders, which are widely used in conventional electrochemical hydrogen storage electrodes, leading to a confining of the performance of rGO for hydrogen storage. As a proof of concept experiment, a novel strategy is developed to fabricate the binder-free sandwich-structured rGO/Co1-x/rGO hybrid paper via facile ball milling and filtration process. Based on the structure investigation, Co1-xS is immobilized in the space between the individual rGO sheets by the creation of chemical "bridges" (C-S bonds). Through the C-S bonds, the atomic hydrogen is transferred from Co1-xS to rGO accompanying a C-H chemical bond formation. When used as an electrode, the hybrid paper exhibits an improved hydrogen storage capacity of 3.82 wt% and, most importantly, significant cycling stability for up to 50 cycles. Excluding the direct hydrogen storage contribution from the Co1-xS in the hybrid paper, the hydrogen storage ability of rGO is enhanced by 10x through the spillover effects caused by the Co1-xS modifier.

TI  - Sulphur-reduced graphene oxide composite with improved electrochemical performance for supercapacitor applications
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this research, carbon nanorods/fibers materials were successfully synthesized from sulphur-reduced graphene oxide (RGO-S) composite by using an improved Hummers' method. Morphological, structural, compositional and textural characterization of the composite material were obtained via scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. The electrochemical performance of the composite sample as a promising supercapacitor electrode revealed a peak specific capacity of 113.8 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) estimated via GCD curves in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. The half-cell could retain a columbic efficiency of about 98.7% with a corresponding energy efficiency of about 98.5% over 2000 constant charge/discharge cycle at a specific current of 5 A g(-1). Remarkably, an assembled hybrid device with carbonized iron cations (C-FP) and the RGO-S composite delivered high energy and power densities of 35.2 Wh kg(-1) and 375 W kg(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) within a 1.5 V operating potential, respectively. A good cycling stability performance with an energy efficiency of 99% was observed for the device for up to 10,000 cycling at a specific current of 3 A g(-1).

TI  - Reduced graphene oxide-poly-(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate)-Pt/Ag nanoscrolls and its electrocatalytic performance for oxidation of methanol
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The reduced graphene oxide-poly-(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate)-Pt/Ag (RGO-PDMAEMA-Pt/Ag) nanoscrolls were prepared by rolling up the RGO-PDMAEMA-Pt/Ag sheets under freezing conditions. The compositions and structures of RGO-PDMAEMA-Pt/Ag sheets and nanoscrolls were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Because of the bimetallic synergetic effect and unique scrolled structure, RGO-PDMAEMA-Pt/Ag nanoscrolls show excellent catalytic performance and high electrochemical stability. The ECSA value of RGO-PDMAEMA-Pt/Ag nanoscrolls for Pt is 891 cm(2)/mg, which is 1.28 times that of the RGO-PDMAEMA-Pt/Ag sheets (698 cm(2)/mg). The ratio of the forward oxidation peak current to the reverse peak current is about 1.25. The electrochemical results indicate the RGO-PDMAEMA-Pt/Ag nanoscrolls are promising electrocatalysts for direct methanol fuel cell. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Synthesis of anatase TiO2 with exposed (001) facets grown on N-doped reduced graphene oxide for enhanced hydrogen storage
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Homogeneously distributed TiO2 nanoparticles with (001) reactive facets were grown over nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide sheets (N-rGO) under solvothermal conditions. Hydrogen storage capacity of the system was significantly improved to 0.91 wt% at room temperature and pressure of 0.8 MPa that is the highest hydrogen storage ever reported for graphene-based nanocomposites at room temperature and low pressures. Importantly, this nanocomposite exhibits similar to 91% capacity retention through 5 cycles with more than 88% release of the stored hydrogen at ambient conditions. Enhanced hydrogen uptake and capacity retention were attributed to the synergistic effect of i) reactive facets of TiO2, ii) high dispersion of nanoparticles with the average size of 6 rim, and strong interaction between substrate and TiO2 nanoparticles through polarized C-N bonding of N-rGO sheets.

AB  - Novel catalyst, cobalt boride @ nickel/reduced graphene oxide abbreviated as Co-B@Ni/RGO nanocomposite was synthesized by precipitation of Co2+ ions on Ni/RGO. In the first step, Ni/RGO nanocomposite was synthesized by a facile method. In the next step, Co-B NPs were decorated on Ni/RGO support which led the superficial attachment and maximum exposure of them for catalytic reaction. The structure, composition and morphology of catalyst were fully characterized using various techniques. Co-B@Ni/RGO nanocomposite showed the high catalytic activity for hydrolysis of alkaline sodium borohydride (NaBH4) solution. Moreover, Co-B@Ni/RGO nanocomposite showed the high current response and stability of catalyst under cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiment, suggested as promising low cost nanocatalyst for future energy applications due to its high catalytic activity, charge storage capability and robustness.

TI  - Pd nanoparticles immobilized on aniline-functionalized MXene as an effective catalyst for hydrogen production from formic acid
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A simple wet chemical method was used to prepare two-dimensional transition metal carbides (MXene); PDA-MXene was prepared by alkalization of p-phenylenediamine (PDA) on MXene. And further, Pd metal nanoparticles (NPs) were conveniently loaded on the surface to catalyze the dehydrogenation of formic acid. The as-prepared Pd/PDA-MXene catalyst for the formic acid dehydrogenation was characterized by XRD, IR, TEM, and XPS. Pd-NPs with a size of about 4 nm were formed upon the PDA-MXene support surface and were well dispersed. The Pd/PDA-MXene exhibited good catalytic activity in the formic acid decomposition process without any additives, and the turnover frequency value at 50 degrees C was 924.4 h-1, which is comparable to most of the reported noble metal catalysts under similar conditions. It is worth mentioning that the prepared catalyst maintained good catalytic activity in five consecutive catalytic cycles of the formic acid dehydrogenation experiment.

TI  - Polyoxomolybdate-derived MoS2/nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide hybrids for efficient hydrogen evolution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrating MoS2 with carbon-based materials, especially graphene, is an effective strategy for preparing highly active non-noble-metal electrocatalysts in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This work demonstrates a convenient hydrothermal method to fabricate molybdenum disulfide nanosheets/nitrogen- doped reduced graphene oxide (MoS2/NGO) hybrids using polyoxomolybdate as the Mo precursor. Introducing more defects and expanding interlayer spacing of MoS2 can be achieved through decreasing the pH value of the reactive system due to the existed high-nuclear polyoxometalate clusters. MoS2/NGO hybrids prepared at low pH exhibit superior HER activity to those obtained at high pH. MoS2/NGO-pH1.5 exhibits an ultralow overpotential of 81 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 60 mV dec(-1) and good stability in alkaline electrolyte. Such excellent electrocatalytic activity is contributed by the abundant HER catalytic active sites, the increased electrochemically-accessible area and the synergetic effects between the active MoS2 catalyst and NGO support.

TI  - Enhanced photoelectrochemical water splitting in hierarchical porous ZnO/Reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite synthesized by sol-gel method
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Today the utilization of solar energy to split water and its conversion to hydrogen and oxygen has been considered as a powerful way to solve the environmental crisis. Hierarchical porous nanostructured ZnO and ZnO/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composite photoanodes are synthesized by innovated sol-gel method using triethylenetetramine (TETA) as a stabilizer. The hierarchical porous ZnO structure containing large agglomerates each consisting of tiny nanoparticles are formed. The X-ray diffraction analysis and Raman spectroscopy confirm the in-situ reduction of graphene oxide sheets during synthesis and formation of ZnO/rGO nanocomposite. Although the band gap and transmittance of the porous nanocomposites do not dramatically change by rGO addition, the main photoluminescence peak quenches entirely showing prolonging exciton lifetime. The ZnO/rGO porous structure achieved remarkably improved current density (1.02 mA cm(-2) at 1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl) in 1 wt% rGO, up to 12 times higher compared to the bare ZnO (0.09 mA cm(-2) at 1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl), which attributes to positive role of ZnO hierarchical porous structure and rGO electron separation/transportation. These findings provide new insights into the broad applicability of this methodology for promising future semiconductor/graphene composite in the field of photoelectrochemical water splitting.

CP  - 14th International Conference on Energy Storage (EnerSTOCK)

AB  - Addressed herein is the synthesis of binary CuPt alloy nanoparticles (NPs), their assembly on reduced graphene oxide (rGO), Vulcan XC72 (VC) and their hybrid (rGO-VC) to be utilized as electrocatalysts for fuel cell reactions (HOR and ORR) in acidic medium and PEMFC tests. The synthesis of nearly-monodisperse Cu45Pt55 alloy NPs was achieved by using a chemical reduction route comprising the reduction of commercially available metal precursors in a hot surfactant solution. As-synthesized Cu45Pt55 alloy NPs were then assembled on three support materials, namely rGO, VC and rGO-VC) via liquid phase self-assembly method. After the characterization, the electrocatalysts were prepared by mixing the yielded materials with Nafion and their electrocatalysis performance was investigated by studying CV and LSV for HOR and ORR in acidic medium. Among the three electrocatalysts tested, Cu45Pt55/rGO-VC hybrid showed the highest catalytic activity with ECSA of 119 m(2) g(-1) and mass activity of 165 mA mg(pt)(-1). After the evaluation of electrochemical performance of the three prepared electrocatalysts, their performance was then evaluated in fuel cell conditions. In similar to electrochemical activities, the Cu45Pt55/rGO-VC hybrid electrocatalyst showed a superior fuel cell performance and power output by providing a maximum power of 480 mW cm(-2) with a relatively low Pt loading (0.28 mg cm(-2)). Additionally, the Cu45Pt55/rGO-VC hybrid electrocatalyst exhibited substantially better activity as compared to Pt/rGO-VC electrocatalyst. Therefore, the present study confirmed that alloying Pt with Cu enhances the catalytic activity of Pt metal along with the help of beneficial features of rGO-VC hybrid support material. It should be noted that this is the first example of studying PEMFC performance of CuPt alloy NPs supported on rGO, VC and rGO-VC hybrid. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB  - In our previous research, titanium-based nitride with high conductivity and superior corrosion resistance were developed as an ideal core material for replacing noble metal to form Pt-based core-shell catalysts by pulse electrodeposition. Meanwhile, the smaller sizes of nitride cores would also be available for pulse electrodeposition by dispersing them on carbon nanotubes (CNT). To achieve a better practice on the preparation of the Pt-based core-shell catalysts, in this work, both nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNT) and reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) were used to support the copper-doped titanium nitride (Ti0.9Cu0.1N) cores. In the course of pulse electrodeposition, their influences as supports on the electronic states of electrodeposited Pt as well as their catalytic activities were compared. The results showed that the Pt preferred to electrodeposit on Ti0.9Cu0.1N cores supported by N-CNT and formed a core-shell structure. While with the same electrode position process, the Pt was found to be electrodeposited not only on the Ti0.9Cu0.1N cores supported by N-rGO with heavy aggregations but also on the N-rGO support. Raman spectroscopy analysis indicated that the higher degree of structural defects on N-rGO, as support, might have contributed to such divergence observation.

TI  - Polyaniline/reduced graphene oxide-modified carbon fiber brush anode for high-performance microbial fuel cells
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Polyaniline (PANI)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) were synthesized by in-situ polymerization and were decorated on mesophase pitch-based carbon fiber brush (Pitch-CB) anode to promote microbial fuel cells (MFCs) power production. Mesophase pitch-based carbon fiber brush (Pitch-CB) becomes one of the most important research objects in MFCs. The mesophase pitch-based carbon fiber (CF) has excellent conductivity (about 2.0 mu Omega m) compared with PAN-based CF (about 30 mu Omega m). But the high conductive CF's surfaces have strong inert, and they are relatively smooth, which make it difficult to be adhered and enriched by microbes. By applying the PANI/rGO composite anode, the maximum power density (MPD) was increased to 862 mW m(-2), which was approximately 1.21 times higher than that of the Pitch-CB. The PANI can improve the surface roughness and surface potential of CFs, thus enhancing the adhesion of microbes and electrogenic performance of MFC. After the rGO was doped, the electrogenic performance of MFC was further improved. This study introduces a promising modifying method for the fabrication of high-performance anodes from simple, environment-friendly materials. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB  - We have prepared a highly efficient and stable platinum-cobalt catalyst supported on graphene oxide by using a one-step synthesis microwave-irradiation process. The structure and composition of two different compositions (Pt:Co(2.5:1)/rGO, Pt:Co(2:1)/rGO) have been investigated by Fourier infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray Photoelectron spectros- copy (XPS), specific surface area (BET), Raman spectroscopy. Their electrocatalytic activity was investigated and the electrochemical response from cyclic voltammetry revealed the high efficiency and stability as well as the potential application as cathode electrode. The electrocatalysts exhibited a superior durability comparing with commercial Pt/C catalyst after accelerated stress test, indicating a lower loss of electrochemical surface area in the case of prepared samples. Moreover, this study extends the applicability of this synthesis method for the preparation of other noble or transitional metal nanoparticles decorated on reduced graphene oxide.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to harness the potential of hydrogen as an alternative energy carrier, overcoming the barrier related to its storage is of utmost importance. In this direction, it has been shown that dissociation of hydrogen molecules into atoms followed by their adsorption onto high surface area nanomaterials like reduced graphene oxide is a promising pathway. In the present study, we have exploited this pathway, commonly known as the "spillover mechanism" and achieved a hydrogen storage capacity of similar to 4.6 wt% at 30 bar and 25 degrees C in Pd3Co decorated boron doped graphene composite. We demonstrate that optimum loading of transition metal alloy nanoparticles coupled with heteroatom (nitrogen or boron) doped graphene support is an efficient, easy and cost effective avenue towards meeting the US department of energy (DOE) targets for gravimetzic hydrogen storage capacity at room temperature and moderate pressures.

TI  - Facile microwave-assisted synthesized reduced graphene oxide/tin oxide nanocomposite and using as anode material of microbial fuel cell to improve power generation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A new nanocomposite material was fabricated by a facile and reliable method for microbial fuel cell (MFC) anode. Tin oxide (SnO2) nanoparticles were anchored on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (RGO/SnO2) in two steps. The hydrothermal method was used for the modification of GO and then microwave-assisted method was used for coating of SnO2 on the modified GO. Nanohybrids of RGO/SnO2 achieved a maximum power density of 1624 mW M-2, when used as the MFC anode. The obtained power density was 2.8 and 4.8 times larger than that of RGO coated and bare anodes, respectively. The electrodes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The electrochemical characteristics were also studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The high conductivity and large specific surface of the nanocomposite were greatly improved the bacterial biofilm formation and increased the electron transfer. The results demonstrate that the RGO/SnO2 nanocomposite was advantageous material for the modification of anode and enhanced electricity generation of MFC.

TI  - CuS-modified ZnO rod/reduced graphene oxide/CdS heterostructure for efficient visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen generation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar energy utilization is a promising strategy for the photocatalytic generation of H-2 from water. Herein, a CuS-modified ZnO rod/reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/CdS heterostructure was fabricated via Cu-induced electrochemical growth with Zn powder at room temperature. The resulting powder revealed good interfacial bonding and promoted photoexcited carrier transport. The CuS nanoparticles played a pivotal role in enhancing visible-light responses and demonstrated excellent catalytic performance. A high visible-light photocatalytic H-2 generation rate of 1073 mmol h(-1) g(-1) was obtained from the CuSeZnO/rGO/CdS heterostructure containing 0.23% CuS and 1.62% CdS. Increased photoexcited electron lifetimes, improved carrier transport rates, and decreased fluorescence intensities confirmed the synergistic effects of each of the components of the heterostructure. This study provides an innovative strategy for constructing multi-component heterostructures to achieve efficient visible-light H-2 evolution. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Graphene-supported Pd-Pt alloy nanoflowers: In situ growth and their enhanced electrocatalysis towards methanol oxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In situ growth of Pd-Pt alloy nanoflowers on host reduced graphene oxide (Pd-Pt ANFs/RGO) nanosheets by one-pot polyallylamine hydrochloride-assisted co-chemical reduction method, is developed. Compared with the common approaches to assembly of nanocatalysts in selected substrates based on pre-synthesized catalyst nanoparticles, the in situ fabrication is more facile, cost-effective and environment-friendly, allowing effective control of the location, distribution and uniformity of the supported Pd-Pt nanoflowers through the entire matrix. The detailed morphology; composition and structure of Pd-Pt ANFs/RGO nanocomposites are investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), selected-area electron diffraction (SAED), energy dispersive spectrum (EDS), and nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms (SADI). TEM images show that Pd-Pt ANFs are directly grown on RGO with porous structure and good dispersion. Against commercial Pd/C catalyst, Pd-Pt ANFs/RGO nanocomposites show superior electrocatalytic activity, stability and satisfactory CO tolerance towards methanol oxidation reaction in basic electrolyte.

TI  - Efficient electro-oxidation of methanol using PtCo nanocatalysts supported reduced graphene oxide matrix as anode for DMFC
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Platinum - cobalt (PtCo) alloy based highly efficient nano electro-catalysts on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) matrix have been synthesized for the electro-oxidation of methanol, by chemical reduction method. Different molar ratio of Pt (IV) and Co (II) ions along with graphene oxide (GO) were reduced using ethylene glycol to obtain PtCo nanoparticles onto rGO sheets (Pt/rGO, PtCo (1:1)/rGO, PtCo (1:5)/rGO, PtCo (1:9)/rGO and PtCo (1:11)/rGO) with 20 wt. % metal and 80 wt. % rGO. The average particle size of PtCo nanoparticles onto rGO support was observed to be 2-5 nm using XRD and TEM analysis. The PtCo (1:9)/rGO nanocomposite catalyst exhibited similar to 23 times higher anodic current density compare to commercially available Pt/C catalyst (1.68 mA/cm(2)) for methanol oxidation reaction. The peak power density of 118.4 mW/cm(2) was obtained for PtCo (1:9)/rGO catalyst in direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) at 100 degrees C, 1 bar, and 2 M methanol as anode feed, which is similar to 3 times higher than that of Pt/C catalyst. The results indicate the potential application of synthesized nanocomposite catalyst in commercial DMFCs. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mussel-inspired strategy towards functionalized reduced graphene oxide-crosslinked polysulfone-based anion exchange membranes with enhanced properties
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Chemical crosslinking is regard as an effective method to balance the ionic conductivity and dimensional stability of anion exchange membranes (AEMs). In this work, a series of crosslinked AEM composite membranes based on polydopamine-functionalized reduced graphene oxide (PDArGO) were constructed from quaternized polysulfone (QPSU) with amino groups via mussel-inspired chemistry strategy. On the one hand, as the dopant, the hydrogen bonding interaction between PDArGO and a large number of amino groups on the side chains of QPSU can enhance the water uptake of the membranes and has a positive influence on the ionic conductivity of composite membranes. On the other hand, PDArGO also acts as the crosslinker, which can form a micro-crosslinked structure with the amino groups on the side chains of the polymer through the Michael addition/schiff base reactions. Under the combined influence of the above two factors, the crosslinked composite AEMs exhibited special delightful properties. In general, the crosslinking reaction will lead to the decrease of the ionic conductivity of the membranes, but as for the membranes prepared by us, the ionic conductivity had been improved to some extent. Especially, the QPSU-1.5%-PDArGO exhibited 57% improvement in the hydroxide conductivity than that of pure QPSU membrane and reached the highest value of 61 mS cm(-1) at 80 degrees C. Besides, the crosslinked membranes also exhibited strong dimensional stability, good mechanical strength, comparable alkaline stability and improved methanol permeability.

AB  - The highly porous electrode of a crisscrossed CoNi nanosheets array grown on reduced graphene oxide decorated Ni foam (CoNi/rGO@Ni foam) is fabricated through a facile dip and dry method followed by electroreduction and electrodeposition methods. The phase composition and morphology of the electrode are characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, and EDS. In single electrode tests, CoNi/rGO@Ni foam electrode displays an excellent catalytic performance (330 mA cm(-2) at 0.6 V) and stability towards urea electrooxidation when comparing to Ni foam and CoNi nanosheets modified Ni foam (CoNi@Ni foam) electrode. Besides, a low initial oxidation potential of urea electro-oxidation to 0.14 V is achieved on the CoNi/rGO@Ni foam electrode. The introducing of rGO to the electrode greatly reduced the reaction activation energy from 14.47 to 10.35 kJ mol(-1). Besides, large active surface area (261.67 cm(2)) is also obtained from the electrode. The CoNi/rGO@Ni foam anode exhibits a maximum power density of 12.58 mW cm(-2) in direct urea-hydrogen peroxide fuel cell tests. Excellent performance shows in single electrode tests and fuel cell tests suggest that addition of rGO to the electrode is an easy and feasible method to enhance the performance of the catalyst.

CP  - 6th Symposium on Hydrogen, Fuel Cells and Advanced Batteries (HYCELTEC)
CL  - Porto, PORTUGAL
AB  - In this work, a comprehensive study on the polyol synthesis of platinum supported on reduced graphene oxide (Pt/rGO) catalysts, including both ex-situ and in-situ characterizations of the prepared Pt/rGO catalysts, was performed. The polyol synthesis was studied considering the influence of the platinum precursor, oxidation level of graphite oxide and pH of reaction medium. The as-prepared catalysts were analyzed using thermogravimetric (TG) analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The best results in terms of platinum particle size and distribution were obtained when the synthesis was performed in acidic medium, using chloroplatinic acid as precursor and using graphene oxide with high oxidation level. The most promising graphene-supported catalyst was used to prepare a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell electrode. The membrane electrode assembly (MEA) prepared with graphene-based electrode was compared with a MEA prepared with catalyst based on commercial platinum supported in carbon black (Pt/C). Single cell characterization included polarization curves and in-situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The graphene-based electrode presented promising albeit unstable electrochemical performance due to water management issues. Additionally, EIS measurements revealed that the MEA made with Pt/rGO catalyst presented a lower mass transport resistance than the commercial Pt/C.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY

AB  - Herein, the ultrafine bimetallic alloy supported on nitrogen doped reduced graphene oxide (PtCu/NrGO) has been developed via wet-reflux strategy and applied as potential catalyst for electro-oxidation of liquid fuels in direct alcohol fuel cells (DAFCs). Possible conversion to PtCu/NrGO from the precursor materials was established in detail using transmission electron microscope (TEM), field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photo electron spectroscopy (XPS). The coupled structure of PtCu along with NrGO endowed an efficient catalyst with excellent catalytic activity and stability toward electro-oxidation of various alcohols compared to commercial Pt/C in acidic electrolyte. PtCu/NrGO exhibits the mass activity of 0.917, 0.620 and 0.495 A/mg(pt) toward the electro-oxidation of methanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol, about 6.8, 6.3 and 8.6 fold increment compared to Pt/C catalyst, respectively. Besides, PtCu/NrGO shows excellent durability with less activity decay even after 500 cycles. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Ruthenium Ion-Complexed Graphitic Carbon Nitride Nanosheets Supported on Reduced Graphene Oxide as High-Performance Catalysts for Electrochemical Hydrogen Evolution
T2  - CHEMSUSCHEM
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon-based materials are promising, low-cost electrocatalysts toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), although the catalytic performance needs to be further improved before commercialization. In this study, ruthenium ions are incorporated into graphitic carbon nitride/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) hybrids to form Ru-C3N4/rGO composites through Ru-N coordination bonds. The incorporation of Ru ions, at a loading of 1.93at.%, leads to electron redistribution within the materials and dramatically enhances the HER performance over those of C3N4, C3N4/rGO, and Ru-C3N4, with an overpotential of only -80mV to reach a current density of 10mAcm(-2), a Tafel slope of 55mVdec(-1), and an exchange current density of 0.462mAcm(-2). This performance is comparable to that of Pt/C, and ascribed to the positive shift of the conduction band of the composite, where the charge carrier density increases by a factor of about 250 over that of C3N4, leading to a lower energy barrier for hydrogen evolution. The results suggest a new strategy in the design and engineering of functional nanocomposites for effective HER electrocatalysis by embedding select metal ions into carbon-based molecular skeletons.

TI  - Synthesis of W2N nanorods-graphene hybrid structure with enhanced oxygen reduction reaction performance
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, a novel hybrid structure of tungsten nitride nanorods upon graphene nano sheets was obtained by synthesizing WO. nanorods/graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets followed by hydrogenation and nitridization treatment. Electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction results indicated that the hybrid was composed of W2N nanorods and reduced graphene oxide nanosheets. Surface chemical characteristics of the hybrid were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and its electrocatalytic activities were evaluated using a rotating disk electrode measurement system. Compared to the WO3 nanorods-GO hybrid, onset potential of the W2N nanorods-rGO hybrid for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was shifted from 0.6 V to 0.71 V, and the limiting current density increased by 1.4 times, exhibiting significantly enhanced electrocatalytic performance, which rendered the W2N-rGO hybrid as a potential non-precious-metal ORR catalyst in fuel cells and metal air battery applications.

TI  - The 2D RGO-NiS2 dual co-catalyst synergistic modified g-C3N4 aerogel towards enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The two-dimension RGO (reduced graphene oxide)-NiS2 dual co-catalyst synergistic modified g-C3N4 nanosheets aerogel is synthesized via the continuous thermal oxidation etching-hydrothermal method-freeze drying process. The results of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) imply that the RGO-NiS2 dual co-catalyst is introduced into the aerogel system successfully. The photocatalytic activity of the RGO-NiS2 synergistic modified g-C3N4 aerogel remarkably exhibits an enhancement of 67 times than that of simplicial g-C3N4. Further, the photocatalytic process and the mechanism of the photocatalytic hydrogen production enhancement are studied, which is ascribed to RGO-NiS2 dual co-catalyst synergistic modification, including the Pt-like behavior of the NiS2 and the high conductivity and large specific surface area of the RGO.

TI  - Bipotential deposition of nickel-cobalt hexacyanoferrate nanostructure on graphene coated stainless steel for supercapacitors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Graphene oxide (GO) was deposited on inexpensive and mechanically stable stainless steel (SS) electrode by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique. GO was reduced electrochemically in NaNO3 to obtain electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO). Next, Hybrid nickel-cobalt hexacyanofarrate (NiCoHCF) nanoparticles were deposited from solution containing Ni+2 and Co+2 with ratio of 1:1 on ERGO/SS by bipotential method. Morphological investigation of prepared sample by scanning electron microscopy showed the presence of nanoparticles with diameters in the range of 15-50 nm. Crystal structure of nanocomposite was investigated by X-ray diffraction technique. Electrochemical behavior of prepared film indicates that hybrid nanocomposite has higher specific capacitance (411 F g(-1)) than ERGO (185.2 F g(-1)) in KNO3 solution at current density of 0.2 A g(-1). In other words, pseudocapacitor that is formed based on the faradaic behavior of NiCoHCF can improve the capacitive performance of ERGO. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

AB  - Addressed herein, we report a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheet coupled with polyaniline (PANI) for platinum (Pt) nanoparticles as supporting materials. The PANI-coupled rGO (PANI@rGO) nanosheet is prepared by a simple one-step chemical assembly strategy, and Pt nanoparticles are anchored on the support of PANI@rGO through the reaction of PANI with a platinum salt. The designed PANI efficiently exposes the surface of rGO sheets and stabilizes metal nanoparticles. Consequently, the Pt@PANI-rGO catalyst exhibits good reusability, durability and high catalytic performance for dimethylamine borane dehydrogenation reaction. The structure morphology and properties of Pt@PANI-rGO NPs were characterized by using several different techniques such as UV-Vis, XPS, TEM, XRD and HR-TEM-EDX analyses. This newly prepared catalyst can be reused again at low concentrations and temperature. They showed a high turnover frequency (42.94 h(-1)) and low Ea value of 15.1 +/- 2 kJ/mol for DMAB dehydrocoupling in the ambient conditions. The proposed nano architecture offers a new pathway to promote the performances of rGO in various applications; moreover, this work provides a powerful and universal synthetic strategy for such an architecture.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A three-dimensional (3D) graphene/Nickel oxide (ERGO/NiO) composite electrode have been fabricated directly on a Nickel foam substrate via a one-step electrochemical co-deposition in an aqueous solution containing Nickel nitrate and GO. By using this simple and one-step electrochemical deposition, it is possible to produce binder-free composite electrodes with improved electrochemical properties using a low-cost, facile and scalable technique. It is observed from FE-SEM images that graphene oxide sheets affect the electrodeposition of nickel oxide. The optimized ErGO/NiO electrode developed in this work exhibits high charge storage capacity with a specific capacitance of 1715.5 F g(-1) at current density 2 A g(-1) and hierarchical morphological structure which facilitates electrolyte diffusion to the electrode surface. A good cycling stability was observed for the modified electrodes in alkaline media. EIS measurements showed low values of internal resistance (R-s) and charge transfer resistance (R-ct) for the modified electrodes, indicating that the prepared nanocomposite is appropriate for supercapacitor applications in comparison to NiO/NF electrode.

TI  - Recent developments in reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites for photoelectrochemical water-splitting applications
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Graphene oxide (GO) sheets have extremely adjustable electronic characteristics due to their distinctive 2D carbon composition, allowing comprehensive surface modifications. Photodriven water splitting uses semiconducting materials that have water-decomposition electronic structures appropriate for electron and hole injection. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) is regarded as an extremely efficient energy conversion system for the manufacturing of clean solar fuel. There have been tremendous attempts to design and create feasible unassisted PEC systems that can effectively divide water to form hydrogen gas and oxygen with only solar energy input (sunlight) necessary. In particular, in the presence of a photocatalyst modified with an appropriate cocatalyst, overall PEC water splitting can be accomplished. For the development of PEC systems, the fundamental concept of PEC water splitting and enhanced energy-conversion efficiency are essential for solar fuel manufacturing. Therefore, this review paper provides a concise summary of unassisted PEC systems with state-of-the-art advancements towards effective PEC water-splitting equipment for the sustainable future use of solar energy.

TI  - Functionalized magnetic nanoparticle-reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite for enzymatic biofuel cell applications
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs) produce electrical energy from green and renewable fuels, by utilizing redox enzyme. However, the main issue of low power output and stability of the electrode still prevails in this field. Extensive research is going on to overcome this problem by improving the electrical communication between the enzyme and the current collector. In the light of this, a new electrode design based on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (f-Fe3O4 NPs) in polyaniline matrix has been proposed and employed for the purpose of the EBFCs application, in order to achieve efficient electron shuttling between enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx) and the electrode surface. The as-prepared rGO/PANI/f-Fe3O4 nanocomposite was examined by analytical techniques viz, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and the electrochemical behaviour of the rGO/PANI/f-Fe3O4 nanocomposite and rGO/PANI/f-Fe3O4/Frt/GOx bioanode was determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The bioanode attained a maximum current density of 32.9 mA cm(-2) at the optimum glucose concentration of 50 mM. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Defect locating: One-step to monodispersed CoFe2O4/rGO nanoparticles for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, monodispersed CoFe2O4/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanoparticles have been successfully synthetized in one step from Co(II) acetylacetonate, Fe(III) acetylacetonate, benzylamine and graphene oxide (GO). A facile solvent method was designed to skillfully integrate the crystal growth process of CoFe2O4, the reduction process of GO and their compound process. In synthesis process, large numbers of defects on GO thin layers were smartly used to disperse CoFe2O4 nanoparticles. The micromorphology and the distribution of as -prepared samples were identified via X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and element mapping spectra. Results showed that the monodispersed CoFe2O4 nanoparticles were uniformly coupled with rGO thin layers. Good performance for both oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution of as-prepared CoFe2O4/rGO (0.92 V onset potential for oxygen reduction and 1.59 V overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution, vs. RHE) were found during a series of electrochemical tests, which make it a promising bi-functional catalyst in the field of fuel cells and metal-air batteries.

CP  - 21st World Hydrogen Energy Conference (WHEC)
CL  - Zaragoza, SPAIN
AB  - Solvothermal and chemical reduction of graphene oxide with N2H4 or HI affect the surface composition, rupture and delamination degree of reduced graphene oxide (rGO). Higher reduction and stacking of rGO was achieved by chemical reduction with HI, while solvothermal reduction and, especially, the chemical reduction with N2H4 lead to higher delamination of rGO. The incorporation of the different rGO to CdS implies changes in the characteristics and photoactivity of the CdS-rGO hybrids. A promoter effect was observed in all CdS-rGO hybrids respect to the photoactivity of bare CdS, observing the better photoactivity on the hybrid in which the graphene oxide was reduced with HI (CdS-rGO/HI). The variations in the photoactivity of CdS-rGO hybrids are analyzed in terms of changes in the structure, surface and light absorption ability of CdS and also analyzing the contact of CdS with rGO. The greater concentration of small CdS nanostructures with strong quantum confinement is in the origin of the enhancement in photoactivity observed in the CdS-rGO/HI hybrid.

AB  - Here, we describe the in-situ synthesis of multicomponent ZnO-based photocatalysts for hydrogen production. We fabricated ZnO coupled with Cu-Cu2O nanoparticles and modified reduced graphene oxide (mRGO) to ameliorate hydrogen production. The simultaneous introduction of mRGO and Cu-Cu2O enhanced the generation rate of photo -catalytic hydrogen to 3085.02 mmol g(-1) h(-1) due to significant alteration of the electronic structure. The bandgap energy of the prepared catalysts decreased from 3.2 eV for pristine ZnO to 2.64 eV for a composite containing 15% Cu-Cu2O. The optimal designed hetero-structure efficiently separates photo charge carriers and prevents charge carriers' recombination by accelerating charge transfer with the help of mRGO and metallic Cu and as a result leading to efficient hydrogen yields.

AB  - The Ag/boehmite nanotubes/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites (Ag/boehmite nanotubes/rGO) have been synthesized for enhanced electrochemical sensing of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD) were applied to characterize the composition and morphology of the nanocomposites. TEM and FESEM images revealed that a great deal of Ag nanoparticles with spherical morphologies were fixed on the surface of boehmite nanotubes/rGO. The sensor based on Ag/boehmite nanotubes/rGO nandcomposites possessed remarkable performance for the electrical reduction of H2O2. and showed a linear response for the detection of H2O2 in the range of 0.5 mu M-10.0 mM with a low detection limit of 0.17 mu M (S/N = 3) and a sensitivity of 80.1 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2). Besides, the as-prepared sensor exhibited outstanding anti-interference capability. Therefore, the excellent experimental results indicated that Ag/boehmite nanotubes/rGO nanocomposites is a promising type of support material for electrochemical detection of H2O2.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The ternary composite comprising reduced graphene oxide (rGO), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanorods is developed and its substantial contribution toward the green energy generation of air cathode microbial fuel cells (ACMFC) as an efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst is evaluated by using the different electrochemical techniques under various regimes and conditions. The effectual distribution of needle like and cubic inverse spinel structured Fe3O4 nanorods over the PEDOT enveloped graphene sheets are elucidated from the electron micrographs and the growth and composite formation mechanisms of Fe3O4 and rGO/PEDOT/Fe3O4, respectively, are enunciated from the detailed structural characterizations. The extended surface area, high electrical conductivity, and large oxygen adsorption sites of rGO/PEDOT/Fe3O4 nanocomposite facilitate the excellent ORR kinetics, which yields the maximum ACMFC power density with the superior durability of more than 600 h. Thus the proposed strategy extends a new approach in bringing the advantages of active carbon, conductive polymer and nanomaterials in a single tool, which constructs the prepared ternary composite as a potential ORR contender to the commercially available catalysts.

TI  - Synthesis and characterizations of graphene/Sm doped BiFeO3 composites photoanode for efficient photo-electrochemical water splitting
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study features Bi1-xSmxFeO3 (BSFO) nanoparticles anchored on high-quality, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets via a two-step ultrasonication method for photo electrochemical (PEC) studies relating to solar hydrogen generation. Sm doping leads to the formation of pure BFO type phase without any secondary phases. The structural, morphological, optical, and local structure analyses of BSFO and BSFO@RGO have been done through X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, UV-Vis spectrophotometer, and Raman spectrometer, respectively. The BSFO nanoparticles have been templated on reduced graphene oxide. The BSFO@RGO has been employed as a photoanode for PEC measurements under the simulated solar irradiation of intensity 100 mW-cm(-1). The optimum photoanode has been found with Bi0.95S0.05FO3@RGO. The highest photocurrent density and solar to hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency have been found as 2.40 mA/cm(2) (at 0.5 V vs. saturated calomel electrode) and 2.45%, respectively. Furthermore, the stability of the photoanode against photo corrosion has also been tested by the chronoamperometric technique. During 2 h experiment, the average photocurrent density has been maintained at 1.5 mA/cm(2) (at 0 V vs. SCE). The improved photocatalytic activity of BSFO@RGO has been explained based on the effect of doping, better solar spectral response, hindering the recombination loss of photo-generated charge carriers, and fast, facile charge transport. Although earlier studies have used Bi(Sm)FeO3 photoanode, hydrogen production has been observed for the first time in the present investigation to the best of our knowledge. Also, it appears that hydrogen production at zero external bias as observed in the present study suggests a new feature for bandgap tailored BFO.

TI  - Controllable O-2(center dot-) oxidization graphene in TiO2/graphene composite and its effect on photocatalytic hydrogen evolution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - TiO2/reduced graphene oxide composite (T-rGO) was synthesized and its performance was evaluated with photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. It was found that the hydrogen evolution rate of T-rGO increased significantly after injecting small amount of air into the vacuum pumped and UV irradiated sealed reaction cell. The IR, XPS, Raman and ESR spectra analysis indicated that the O-2(center dot-), which generated from the reaction of photoinduced electrons and the injected O-2 can moderately and controllably increase the oxygen groups on graphene planar of T-rGO at ambient condition. The amount of oxygen groups on graphene planar of T-rGO will affect the p-doping concentration of graphene, thus affect the p-n junction and the performance of T-rGO for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

TI  - Efficient photo-catalytic hydrogen production performance and stability of a three-dimensional porous CdS NPs-graphene hydrogel
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We designed a novel CdS nanoparticles composite graphene hydrogel. Under sunlight, the CdS nanoparticles (NPs) -reduced graphene oxide hydrogel (rGH) had the highest hydrogen production rate of 6.44 mmol/g, which is 1.3 times that of CdS nanoparticles (5.12 mmol/g) and 1.4 times that of CdS (4.6 mmol/g). The enhanced photo-catalytic activity can be attributed to several positive factors such as the formation of composite hydrogels and the quantum size effect of the CdS nanoparticles nanomaterials. The formation of the composite hydrogel improves the specific surface area of the catalyst and increases the active site on the catalyst surface. The quantum size effects of the CdS nanoparticles effectively reduce the recombination probability of electrons and holes. The close contact between the CdS nanoparticles and the graphene gel can effectively separate photo-generated electrons and holes via the unique large pi-bond structure of graphene. These positive factors effectively improve the photocatalytic activity of composite materials for water decomposition. In addition, recovery experiments show a composite catalyst recovery rate of up to 95%. The results show that the composite photo-catalyst can effectively avoid secondary pollution during photo-catalytic hydrogen production. This eliminates powder recovery problems. The hydrogen production efficiency of the catalyst remains unchanged after 5 cycles indicating that the formation of the gel system stabilizes the catalyst and inhibits light corrosion of CdS nanoparticles.

AB  - CeOx-modified NiFe catalysts with branched nanodendritic architectures have been successfully deposited on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) through a simple co-reduction method. Thanks to the synergistic electronic effect between Ni, Fe, and Ce, as well as dendritic morphology with a high number of active sites, the resulted Ni3Fe-(CeOx)(0.15)/rGO exhibited superior catalytic activity toward dehydrogenation of hydrous hydrazine in alkaline condition, with turnover frequency (TOF) values of 56.8 h(-1), and 126.2 h(-1) at 328, and 343 K, respectively.

TI  - Facile synthesis of VS4/graphene nanocomposites and their visible-light-driven photocatalytic water splitting activities
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - VS4/reduced graphene oxide (VS4/rGO) composites are successfully synthesized via a one-step hydrothermal route. Then their photocatalytic activities are examined by water splitting reaction, and the morphology and structure are characterized by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and thermo gravimetric analysis, respectively. It is shown that graphene accelerates the nucleation during the growth period of VS4. Main product is VS4, not VS2. Monoclinic VS4 particles interact with graphene through chemical action. VS4/rGO composites show excellent photocatalytic water splitting activities under visible-light irradiation. This excellent performance is due to the formation of pi-conjugated structure, which can transmit electrons from S2(p) to graphene rapidly. However, composites with excess graphene show poor dispersion, which leads to the best doping ratio of graphene is 5 wt%. Copyright (c) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

TI  - One-pot synthesis of graphene/carbon nanospheres/graphene sandwich supported Pt3Ni nanoparticles with enhanced electrocatalytic activity in methanol oxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A facile method was demonstrated for the preparation of Pt3Ni alloy nanoparticles supported on a sandwich-like graphene sheets/carbon nanospheres/graphene sheets substrate (Pt3Ni-C/rGO) through a one-pot solvothermal process in N,N-dimethylformide without the addition of reducing agents and surfactants. Transmission electron microscopic measurements showed that carbon nanospheres were homogeneously dispersed in the matrix of exfoliated graphene sheets, and Pt3Ni nanoparticles were distributed on the graphene surfaces without apparent agglomeration, where the average core size was estimated to be 12.6 +/- 2.4 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies demonstrated that electron transfer likely occurred from the Pt3Ni alloy nanoparticles to the graphene sheets. Electrochemical measurements showed that the mass activity of the Pt3Ni C/rGO catalysts in methanol oxidation was 1.7-times higher than that of Pt3Ni nanoparticles supported on reduced graphene oxide alone (Pt3Ni/rGO), and 1.3-times higher than that of commercial Pt/C (20 wt%). Additionally, CO tolerance and durability were also remarkably enhanced. These superior electrocatalytic activities were attributed to the following major factors: (i) the insertion of carbon nanospheres into the graphene matrix prevented restacking/refolding of the graphene sheets, leading to an increasing number of accessible active sites as well as transport channels for mass and charges; and (ii) the synergetic effect between Pt3Ni nanoparticles and rGO weakened the bonding interactions with reactant species, as manifested by the enhanced kinetics of methanol oxidation and CO oxidative desorption.

TI  - L-cysteine-assisted synthesis of ruthenium sulfide/thermally reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites: Promising electrode materials for high-performance energy storage applications
T2  - ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes a facile, single-step hydrothermal method to prepare ruthenium sulfide/thermally reduced graphene oxide (RuS2/TRGO) nanocomposites. In this synthesis procedure, aqueous solutions of RuCl3, L-cysteine, and graphene oxide are employed as the metal, sulfur, and graphene sources, respectively. The chemical structures and morphologies of the nanocomposites are characterized by Xray diffraction, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy are used to examine their electrochemical performances. The RuS2 nanoparticles (similar to 10 nm) uniformly disperse on the surfaces of the TRGO layers to form the RuS2/TRGO composite, which adequately inhibits aggregation of the RuS2 to fully exploit its impressive electrochemical activity and capacitance as a pseudocapacitive electrode material. The combination of the TRGO interconnected conductive networks and uniformly anchored RuS2 generates a specific capacitance of 193 F g(-1) at a 5 mV s(-1) scan rate, 150 F g(-1) at a 0.5 A g(-1) current density, good rate capability (57.3% retention at 6.25 A g(-1)), and reasonable cycle stability (90% retention of capacitance over 2000 cycles at a current density of 0.75 A g(-1)). Further, the RuS2/TRGO-30 composite electrode achieves energy densities of 20.84 and 6.11 Wh kg(-1) at power densities of 250 and 3666.7 W kg(-1), respectively. The RuS2/TRGO composites are promising for high-level energy storage applications because of their superior electrochemical activities. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Porous CoS2 nanostructures based on ZIF-9 supported on reduced graphene oxide: Favourable electrocatalysis for hydrogen evolution reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The research and developments of porous, highly active non-noble metal cathode materials are the current hot spots. In our work, ZIF-9 (Zeolitic imidazolate framework-9) as a cobalt source provide porous structure, we have sulfurized the ZIF-9 into CoS2 by a simple hydrothermal method. Ultimately, the porous CoS2/RGO cathode material was obtained. Through a series of characterization analyses (powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy), it is confirmed that the CoS2/RGO composite was successfully formed. Furthermore, electrochemical tests demonstrated that the pursued catalyst exhibited remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities with a favorable overpotential (only 180 mV for 10 mA cm(-2) vs reversible hydrogen electrode), a low Tafel slopes (75 mV decade(-1)) and high stability in acidic condition (more than 18 h).

TI  - Electrodeposited graphene hybridized graphitic carbon nitride anchoring ultrafine palladium nanoparticles for remarkable methanol electrooxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploiting high performance electrocatalysts is crucial for the effective electrooxidation of methanol, although some barriers exist. Herein, we develop a hybrid support composed of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) synergistically anchoring sufficient ultrafine palladium (Pd) nanoparticles via a simple one-step electrodeposition technique. The morphology and structure were characterized by scanning/transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which confirmed that the Pd nanoparticles were massively and uniformly dispersed on the support of g-C3N4@rGO with a the average particle size of 5.87 nm, deriving from the nitrogen in g-C3N4 contributing to the electron transport highway on the rGO nanosheet layer surface. Furthermore, electrochemical results suggested that the Pd/g-C3N4@rGO showed a high electrocatalytic efficiency for methanol oxidation with a high current density reached 0.131 mA cm(-2). Based on a novel approach to the g-C3N4@rGO hybrid nanostructure, this work offers a promising method for the design and synthesis for the superior performance methanol electrocatalyst.

TI  - Fabrication of robust CoP/Ni2P/CC composite for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction and the reduction of graphene oxide
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing the novel catalysts with an excellent performance of hydrogen generation is essential to facilitate the application of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, a heterostructured cobalt phosphide/nickel phosphide/carbon cloth (CoP/Ni2P/CC) composite was fabricated via an interfacial engineering strategy to achieve the modification of CoP nanoleaf on Ni2P nanosheet skeleton supported by carbon cloth. By virtue of the unique heterostructure, abundant exposing active sites and the synergistic coupling effect of CoP and Ni2P nanoparticles, the elaborated CoP/Ni-2 P/CC composite exhibits a robust catalytic property. Among fabricated composites, the optimal CoP/Ni2P/CC-4 catalyst behaves an excellent HER performance at a wide pH range (overpotentials of 67, 71 and 95 mV to afford 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1 M KOH and 1 M PBS, respectively). The HER current density of this composite shows a negligible degradation after continuous test for 24 h. Charmingly, the HER process of this catalyst was innovatively applied to reduce graphene oxide, and thus exploiting the fabrication route of reduced graphene oxide (rGO). We are sure that this work will provide a firm guideline for the exploitation of pH-universal HER catalysts and the exploration of HER application. (C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - A graphite sheet modified with reduced graphene oxide-hyper-branched gold nanostructure as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrogen is considered as the most important energy carrier for the future. Water electrolysis is a green method for hydrogen production and simple technology that produces very clean gases. However, the main problems with this method are that this process possesses slow kinetic, consumes many energies and its common electrocatalyst is platinum (Pt) based which is an expensive and rare substance. The use of accessible electrocatalyst materials with new shape or structure, which can reduce the overpotential for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is one of the ways to increase the efficiency of the electrolyzers. Herein, first, a graphite sheet was modified with graphene oxide (GO) and then a hyperbranched structure of gold was electrodeposited on it by controlling the electrodeposition conditions. The electrode surface was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The HER performance of the prepared electrodes was evaluated using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. The as-prepared electrode revealed outstanding HER performance with a near-zero onset overpotential (4.7 mV), overpotential of 44 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a high current density of 127.9 mA cm(-2) at 200 mV and also satisfactory stability. Such results suggest that this electrocatalyst is promising for generating clean energy on an industrial scale. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Nanostructure polyoxometalates containing Co, Ni, and Cu as powerful and stable catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction in acidic and alkaline solutions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A new form of [PW11MO39](5-)@Ru-reduced graphene oxide (rGO) (M: Co, Ni, and Cu) was prepared by depositing [PW11MO39](5-) on the surface of Ru-rGO. The behaviour of the polyoxometalates (POMs) toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was studied in acidic and alkaline media. Different techniques were used for the characterization of the nano composites. These included voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to determine the electrocatalytic properties of the nanocomposites toward HER, and Tafel plots to calculate the kinetic parameters and to identify the possible mechanisms involved in the HER process. Results showed that HER on [PW11MO39](5-)@Ru-rGO electrodes obeyed the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. The enhanced HER rates on the modified electrodes were attributed not only to the presence of POM nanoparticles on the electrode surface but also to the resulting enhanced surface areas. These results demonstrate the effective performance of the nanocomposites used as HER catalysts in acidic and alkaline media in conformance with green chemistry objectives. The catalysts are especially advantageous for their desirable capacity, durability, favourable kinetics, and low price. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - With regards to tackling environmental issues from an economical perspective, hydrogen (H-2) is considered as one of the promising and important alternative energy feedstock. Thus it is essential to develop highly efficient and economical catalyst for H-2 generation. In the present study, a new nanocomposite which is composed of ionic liquid functionalized reduced graphene oxide (rGO-IL) anchoring copper oxide nanoparticles was synthesized via chemical route. Detailed structural investigations of the rGO-IL-CuO nanocomposite material was done by X-ray diffractions and microscopic techniques employing scanning electron and high resolution transmission electron. The as-prepared nanocomposite was further characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The nanocomposite showed excellent catalytic activity towards H-2 generation from the hydrolysis of sodium borohydride. The activation energy of rGO-IL-CuO nanocomposite catalyst was found to be 46.1 kJ/mol. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Ternary composites of TiO2 nanotubes with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and meso-tetra (4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin for enhanced visible light photocatalysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Meso-tetra (4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (H2TCPP) loaded on the surface of TiO2 nanotubes (TNTs) by modification of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanostructures has been successfully performed through improved hydrothermal and heating reflux composite technology. The influence of rGO and H2TCPP on the co-photocatalytic behavior of TNT during the degradation of Methylene blue (MB) were studied. The novel photocatalysts have been characterized and analyzed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM), elemental mapping by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, ultraviolet visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). The results from these investigations provide a deeper insight into the materials chemistry of H2TCPP/rGO-TNT nanocomposites. Additionally, the photocatalytic activity was evaluated by the photodegradation of MB under irradiation with visible light. The degradation results showed a purification of more than 92% MB in wastewater, which is about 4.3 times higher than that of the pure TNT. The results confirm that the prepared H2TCPP/rGO-TNT nanocomposites possess superior absorption and co-photocatalytic activities. First, graphene works as the adsorbent, electron acceptor and transporter to efficiently increase the separation of the electron hole pairs. Then it can accelerate the decomposition of organic pollutants. Second, the H2TCPP plays a critical role in capturing photons and expands the absorption wavelength to the visible light region when dealing with water resource.

TI  - The catalytic performance enhancement of Ni2P electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction by carbon-based substrates
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Combination of catalytic active components with substrates is deemed to be a promising approach to pursue high active and stable catalysts. Wherein, carbon-based materials as a kind of frequently-used substrates are well developed, and thus the different effects of them on catalytic active components deserve investigating and contrasting. In this work, well dispersive and ultrafine Ni2P nanoparticles supported on N-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-RGO) were synthesized through a facial hydrothermal process and subsequent phosphorization. The prepared Ni2P/N-RGO demonstrates a superior electrocatalytic activity towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution with a low onset overpotential (80 mV) and small Tafel slope (93.1 mV dec(-1)). Additionally, as compared with other representative carbon materials (carbon black (C) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs)) in the perspective of specific surface area (SSA), conductivity and electronic interaction in particular, N-RGO demonstrates a preeminent promotional effect as a substrate of Ni2P.

TI  - Enhanced power generation, faster transient response and longer durability of HT-PEMFC using composite polybenzimidazole electrolyte membrane with optimum rGO loading
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Here we report enhanced power generation, faster transient response and longer durability of HT-PEMFC by employing a composite membrane of PBI with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) at an optimum loading of 1%. Easy and low cost synthesis of the composite membranes at different loading of rGO is achieved using methane sulfonic acid (MSA) as solvent that resolves the long-standing issue of poor solubility of PBI in the conventional solvents. Property and performance mapping with respect to rGO loading not only leads to attain the optimum but also identifies the window of feasible operating zone. It is observed that with very low (1%) rGO content, composite PBI membrane (rGO-PBI-1) offers the maximum enhancement of all properties viz water uptake, acid uptake, proton conductivity, ion exchange capacity, acid retention capacity, chemical stability, yield strength, while beyond a threshold/critical loading (similar to 4%) deterioration of electrochemical and mechanical properties occur. Steady state performance analysis reveals almost two times peak power enhancement of HT-PEMFC using rGO-PBI-1 electrolyte membrane at an operating temperature of 170 degrees C; in situ impedance analysis during fuel cell operation reveals sharp decay in charge transfer resistance. Multiple step response analysis confirms (similar to 2 times) faster transient response of fuel cell using rGO-PBI-1 while compared to that with pristine PBI membrane. Fuel cell stability analysis ensures longer durability of operation with negligible decay in voltage. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Pt-rGO-TiO2 nanocomposite by UV-photoreduction method as promising electrocatalyst for methanol oxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Pt/TiO2-decorated reduced graphene oxide composite as catalyst for methanol electro-oxidation with three phase junction structure has been synthesized by UV-photoreduction (denoted as p-Pt/rGO@TiO2). The obtained p-Pt/rGO@TiO2 has been detailedly characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA). XRD and TEM characterizations indicate that photoreduction is favorable to anchoring Pt nanoparticles (NPs) (ca. 2.2 nm) at the interface between TiO2 and reduced graphene oxide (rGO), and forming the Pt, TiO2 and rGO three phase junction structure. P-Pt/rGO@TiO2 exhibits a higher activity for methanol electro-oxidation than m-Pt/rGO and m-Pt/rGO@TiO2 (prepared by microwave-assisted polyol process). Lifetime tests demonstrate that the electrochemical durability of p-Pt/rGO@TiO2 is improved by a factor of 2 or more as compared with m-Pt/rGO and m-Pt/rGO@TiO2. XPS characterizations of p-Pt/rGO@TiO2 reveal stronger interaction between Pt and support hybrid compared with m-Pt/rGO@TiO2, which facilitates poisoning species removal and prevents Pt nanoparticles from migrating/agglomerating on or detaching from carbon support. This provides a facile and promising strategy to improve both the activity and durability of electrocatalysts for DMFCs. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

TI  - Enhanced photocatalytic activities of NiS decorated reduced graphene oxide for hydrogen production and toxic dye degradation under visible light irradiation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Semiconductor nanoparticles have extensively studied for a decade on photocatalytic hydrogen production and remediation of toxic pollutants due to their better activities at nano regime and quantum efficiency. The present study reports on the preparation of NiS nanoparticles decorated reduced-graphene oxide nanocomposite (RGO) as an effective visible photo-catalyst for H2 production and a toxic organic dye degradation. NiS and RGO were synthesized by hydrothermal and modified Hummer's method, respectively. The synthesized nanocomposite was thoroughly investigated for its structural and optical properties by various techniques such as XRD, UV-Vis-DRS, FT-IR, Raman, FE-SEM, HR TEM, EDAX, XPS, AFM, BET and XPS. The morphology indicates sphere like particles of NiS dispersed on the surface of the RGO layers. Raman spectral analysis of the nanocomposite materials showed the ID/IG intensity ratios in RGO-NiS (1.00) and GO (1.08) which confirmed that the prepared nanocomposite material has lesser defects. The specific surface area of the prepared nanocomposite was found to be 142.68 m2 g-1. Different experimental parameters such as effect of pH, loading of catalyst and kinetics of dye photodegradation and H2 production were optimized to maximize the photocatalytic activities of the nanocomposite materials. It was observed that maximum % of dye degradation occurred at neutral pH with catalyst loading of 10 mg/10 mL of 10 ppm dye and exhibited 99% degradation under visible light irradiation for 6 h. The prepared nanocomposite material was also employed for H2 production from water through photo-splitting method and it resulted in a maximum hydrogen production as 1368 and 2946 mmol g1h-1 for RGO-NiS and RGO-NiS/Pt respectively with loading of 100 mg catalyst. It was observed that 4.6 and 2.19 fold increase in hydrogen production with pristine NiS and RGO-NiS nano composite respectively with good reusability. Hence, the prepared visible active RGO-NiS nanocomposite could be a suitable catalyst for the oxidation of organic impurities and hydrogen generation from water.

TI  - Graphene-sulfur-Ni(OH)(2) sandwich foam composites as free-standing cathodes for high-performance Li-S batteries
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are considered as a next-generation energy storage solution thanks to the dramatic increase in their energy density and the accompanying low fabrication cost. Nonetheless, their practical applications have been hampered by critical challenges such as cycling instability, low sulfur utilisation and efficiency. Here, the interfacial growth of Ni(OH)(2)-encapsulated sulfur nanoparticles in a reduced graphene oxide free-standing matrix as Li S cathodes has been highlighted, along with a detailed application investigation of the sandwich foam structure in Li-S batteries. Compared to sulfur composites based solely on a graphene host (S@rGO), this composite foam cathode could provide significant improvements in specific capacity and long-cycle stability with the effective confinement and promoted conversion of lithium polysulfides. Moreover, the sandwich foam composite cathode exhibits a high specific capacity of 1189 mA h g(-1) (0.1 C), better rating performance (691 mA h g(-1) at 2 C) and remarkable cycling stability, retaining 81% of the initial capacity after 200 cycles of charge -discharge at 0.2 C. Furthermore, Ni(OH)(2) wrapping at the cathode-electrolyte interface offers vastly improved polysulfide shuttle suppression, which provides a new cathode encapsulation method for further developments of advanced Li-S cathodes.

TI  - Tin disulfide based ternary composites for visible light driven photoelectrochemical water splitting
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting could potentially solve the global energy crisis and environmental pollution. In the present work, ternary composites consisting of 2D nanomaterials of SnS2, reduced graphene oxide (RGO), and mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (mpg-C3N4) are synthesized with layered architecture. The photocurrent density of the ternary composite is 1.45 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs RHE, which is over 23 times higher than that of pure SnS2. The superior photocatalytic activity of mpg-C3N4/SnS2/RGO composite is attributed to synchronous effects of all the materials leading to enhanced electron-hole pair separation, as well as increased visible-light absorption.

TI  - A non-noble metal oxide Ti2O3/rGO composite as efficient and highly stable electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing low-cost and high-performance non-precious metal catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is highly desirable. Herein, the Ti2O3/reduced graphene oxide (Ti2O3/rGO) composite was successfully prepared by solid state synthesis. The electrochemical experiments indicated that the Ti2O3/rGO composite presents an excellent electrocatalytic activity and high selectivity for ORR via a four - electron pathway. Moreover, this composite also has outstanding durability and superior methanol tolerance compared with a commercial Pt/C catalyst in the alkaline (0.1M KOH) media. The superior ORR performance of Ti2O3/rGO composite may be ascribed to the low valence Ti, and the synergetic chemical coupling effects between Ti2O3 and rGO.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Graphene based nanocomposites have the potential to work as efficiently, multifunctional materials for energy conversion & storage. These composites may exhibit better photocatalytic properties by the improvement of their electronic and structural properties than pure photocatalysts. In the present work, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) & ZnO nanocomposite with 0-5 atom% Ag doping was prepared by electrodeposition method and characterized by XRD, Raman spectroscopy, FE-SEM, EDX, UV-Vis spectroscopy and final photoelectrochemical activity was assessed under 1.5 AM solar simulator in 1 M NaOH as electrolyte. Significant changes in the Raman spectrum for the nanocomposite suggest the possible electronic interaction between rGO and ZnO nanocomposite and its successful fabrication, which improves the charge separation and enhanced photoelectrochemical activity in the nanocomposite. We find a red-shift of 0.35 eV in the UV-vis spectrum and therefore an enhanced photoelectrochemical activity in the visible range on Ag doping in rGO/ZnO nanocomposite. Nanocomposite with 1 atom% Ag doping showed the highest photocurrent density of 2.48 mA/cm(2) at 0.8 V vs Ag/AgCl over other samples, which was almost five times higher than that for undoped rGO/ZnO composite. Calculated Flat-band potential and donor densities using Mott-Schottky data also supported the better photoelectrochemical response for Ag doping in nanocomposite.

AB  - In this work, unique gamma-In2Se3 nanoparticles/alpha-In2Se3 nanosheets (In2Se3 NPS) homojunction was prepared to facilitate the transfer and separation of internal carriers, and then reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was introduced to enhance the photocatalytic activity of In2Se3 NPS by in-situ solvothermal method. The obtained In2Se3 NPS/rGO homo-heterojunctions exhibited 3.25 times higher H-2 evolution rate (4497.24 mmol g(-1) h(-1)) and good stability compared with pristine In2Se3 NPS, which was ascribed to efficient separation and migration of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, abundant active sites and reduced overpotential of H-2 evolution over the above homo-heterojunction structure with strong interaction between rGO and In2Se3 NPS. This work provides a promising approach and new insight to fabricate homo-heterojunction photocatalyst with an excellent electronic structure toward photocatalytic water splitting.

TI  - Growth of polyaniline on rGO-Co3S4 nanocomposite for high-performance supercapacitor energy storage
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, since the supercapacitors have drawn considerable attention, a vast study have been triggered in order to develop efficient electrodes for responding to the increasing demand of supercapacitors. In this report, a possible approach have been used to prepare a ternary nanocomposite, polyaniline/reduced graphene oxide-cobalt sulfide (PANI/rGO-Co3S4). At first, a simple and inexpensive hydrothermal route has been used for the preparation of cobalt sulfide (Co3S4) on the surface of graphene oxide sheets (rGO-Co3S4). Then, the polyaniline nanorods have been flourished on the surface of rGO-Co3S4 sheets via in situ chemical polymerization of aniline which was synergistically adjoined to the graphene surface. Polyaniline has uniformly covered the surface of the rGO-Co3S4 due to the rational combination of two components. Combining of PANI with rGO-Co3S4 electrode material amplify its electrochemical efficiency in terms of a high specific capacitance of 767 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) and 81.7% of specific capacitance maintenance after 5000 cycles due to the creation of synergistic effect. Therefore, the ternary nanocomposite of PANI/rGO-Co3S4 provides a new promising pathway for the expanding of high-performance electrode materials for supercapacitors.

Herein, a series of Pd NPs modified freestanding electrodes with a super clean surface and easy repeating process for methanol oxidation reaction is reported. Pd NPs with different coverage were deposited on Ni foams and three-dimensional graphene-Ni foams, respectively. Owning to the special three-dimensional structure of Ni foam, the Pd NPs-Ni foam composite exhibited remarkable activity and unusually long-term stability for methanol electro-oxidation. The introduced three-dimensional graphene prepared by conventional chemical vapour deposition improved the electrocatalytic performance.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Designing an efficient and stable electrocatalyst made of earth abundant elements to take over expensive noble metal based for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) have been focused. Cobalt disulfide-molybdenum disulfide nanocomposite supported by nitrogen doped reduced graphene oxide and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CoS2/MoS2@NrGO-MWCNT) is reported as an efficient electrocatalyst for HER. CoS2/MoS2@N-rGO-MWCNT and ternary hybrids composed of CoS2, MoS2 and N-rGO/MWCNT have been investigated. The catalysts were prepared by facile hydrothermal method, and the optimal doping ratio referred to date cobalt to molybdenum as 2:1 was chosen. It is found that co-existence of CoS2, MoS2 brings abundant active sites and incorporation of MWCNT offered stability. Good dispersion of CoS2 nanoparticles on graphene and MoS2 sheets is observed. Additionally nitrogen doping on rGO sheets has been carried out to boost up the electronegativity of the catalyst as a support to enhance the catalytic activity of CoS2/MoS2 for refine structure and better electrical conductance. Precisely, CoS2/MoS2@N-rGO-MWCNT exhibited smaller tafel slope 73 mV dec(-1) at overpotential 281 mV for current density 10 mA cm(-2) and the substantial stability of 14 h is recorded in 0.5 M H2SO4 medium, results suggest that catalyst is viable alternate for HER.

TI  - Efficient hydrogen evolution catalytic activity of graphene/metallic MoS2 nanosheet heterostructures synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal process
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Metallic (1T)-transition metal dichalcogenides is of excellent optical and electrical properties and so especially suitable for various applications including hydrogen evolution catalysis, electronics, and photoelectrons. To date, achieving 1T-MoS2 nanosheets with a simple chemical process still is a challenge. Here we report a hydrothermal synthesis of the 1T-MoS2 nanosheets by incorporating reduced graphene oxide (RGO) or using citric acid/slow successive heating. A small amount of RGO induced the formation of pure 1T-MoS2 nanosheets. Citric acid/slow successive heating induced the formation of 1T-MoS2 nanosheets with a small amount of 2H-MoS2. Citric acid/slow successive heating also resulted in smaller average particle size in the present of RGO. Synthesized 1T-MoS2 nanosheets and RGO/1T-MoS2 nanosheet hybrids showed remarkably enhanced conduction and wettability compared with their semiconductor (2H)-nanostructures. Thus, dramatically enhanced hydrogen evolution catalytic activity and stability compared with the 2H-nanostructures were observed. RGO/1T-MoS2 nanosheet hybrids synthesized by incorporating graphene oxide and using citric acid/slow successive heating exhibited greatest photocatalytic activity (71.2 mmol/g.h) and electrocatalytic activity (onset potential of -15 mV vs. reversible hydrogen electrode and Tafel slopes of 43 mV/decade). These facile processes might also be significant for the synthesis and application of other 1T-transition metal dichalcogenides nanosheets and their hybrids with RGO.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sulphur-reduced graphene oxide/cobalt oxide composites (RGO-S/Co3O4) were successfully synthesized by varying mass loading of Co3O4 through a simple hydrothermal method. Structural, morphological, chemical compositional and surface area/pore-size distribution analysis of the materials were obtained by using XRD, Raman spectroscopy, SEM, TEM, EDX, FTIR, XPS and BET techniques, which reveal an effective synthesis of the RGO-S/Co3O4 composites. Electrochemical performance of the materials was evaluated using a three and two-electrode system in 1 M KOH electrolyte. An optimized RGO-S/200 mg Co3O4 composite displayed the highest specific capacity of 171.8 mA h g(-1)and superior cycling stability of 99.7% for over 5000 cycles at 1 and 5 A g(-1), respectively, in a three-electrode system. A fabricated supercapattery device utilizing RGO-S/200 mg Co3O4 (positive electrode) and activated carbon from peanut shells (AC-PS) (negative electrode), revealed a high specific energy and power of 45.8 W h kg(-1) and 725 W kg(-1), respectively, at 1 A g(-1). The device retained 83.4% of its initial capacitance for over 10, 000 cycles with a columbic efficiency of 99.5%.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Transition metal carbide catalysts are the alternative products of traditional noble metal Pt/C in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Oleic acid-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (F3O4@OA) was prepared by pyrolysis, assembled with reduced graphene oxide (rGO), and carbonized at 800 degrees C to obtain N doped iron carbide nanoparticles supported rGO (N-Fe3C/rGO). The particle size of nanocrystals increases significantly with the graphene loading risen can be seen in the transmission electron microscope (TEM) image which roughly distributed around 40 nm. The linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) curve shows the material has an ORR performance equivalent to Pt/C in alkaline media. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - One-pot synthesis of CdS-MoS2/RGO-E nano-heterostructure with well-defined interfaces for efficient photocatalytic H-2 evolution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Quality of interfaces is a key factor determining photoexcited charge transfer efficiency, and in turn photocatalytic performance of heterostructure photocatalysts. In this paper, we demonstrated CdS-MoS2/RGO-E (RGO-E: reduced graphene oxide modified by ethylenediamine) nanohybrid synthesized by using a facile one-pot solvethermal method in ethylenediamine, with CdS nanoparticles and MoS2 nanosheets intimately growing on the surface of RGO. This unique high quality heterostructure facilitates charge separation and transportation, and thus effectively suppressing charge recombination. As a result, the CdS-MoS2/RGO-E exhibits a state-of-the-art H-2 evolution rate of 36.7 mmol g(-1) h(-1) and an apparent quantum yield of 30.5% at 420 nm, which is the advanced performance among all the same-type photocatalysts (see Table S1), and far exceeding that of bare CdS by higher than 104 times. This synthesis strategy gives an inspiration for the synthesis of other compound catalysts, and higher performance photocatalyst may be obtained. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Green synthesis of Ag/Fe3O4/RGO nanocomposites by Punica Granatum peel extract: Catalytic activity for reduction of organic pollutants
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The magnetically separable Ag/Fe3O4/RGO nanocomposites (NCs) were synthesized through a green method using Punica Granatum peel extract as a reducing and stabilizing agent. The total phenolic content (TPC) in the Punica Granatum peel extract and the ability of extract to scavenge the DPPH radical were measured and the results proved that the extract has the ability of reduction of Ag+ ions and graphene oxide (GO) to Ag nanoparticles (NPs) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO), respectively. Furthermore, the presence of phenolic compounds in the extract was confirmed using UV-Vis and FT-IR techniques. Deposition of Ag NPs on the surface of Fe3O4/RGO NCs was confirmed by color change from transparent to brown with maximum absorption at 418 nm which is due to surface plasmon resonance of Ag NPs. The crystalline nature of the Ag/Fe3O4/RGO NCs was identified utilizing XRD analysis. The catalytic activity of the green synthesized Ag/Fe3O4/RGO NCs was evaluated in the reduction of organic pollutants such as 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), methylene blue (MB), methyl green (MG) and methyl orange (MO) in water at mild conditions. The results indicated that the biosynthesized NCs have very high and effective catalytic activity for the different types of dyes within few seconds. The morphology and catalytic activity of the Ag/Fe3O4/RGO NCs was compared with Ag/RGO and Ag/Fe3O4 NCs, which were synthesized using Punica Granatum peel extract. The results revealed that the unique synergistic effect of Ag NPs and immobilization over supporters of RGO and Fe3O4 magnetite composite assisted in the reduction of 4-NP, MB, MG and MO.

TI  - Size-controllable synthesis of ultrafine PtNi nanoparticles uniformly deposited on reduced graphene oxide as advanced anode catalysts for methanol oxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A one-pot thermos-reduction strategy is developed to prepare ultrafine PtNi alloy nano particles (NPs), which are uniformly deposited onto reduced graphene oxides (RGOs) in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). The size of PtNi NPs on RGOs can be tuned from 2.5 to 5.4 nm, after Ni was alloyed with Pt by Pt/Ni atomic ratio increased from 2:1 to 5:1. The electrochemical investigation demonstrates that Ni modification can promote the electrocatalytic activity of Pt catalysts on oxidation of methanol with a mass current density up to 1065 mA mg(-1), which is 2.65 times that of Pt catalysts without Ni modification, and comparable to and even better than those of the Pt-based catalysts reported recently.

TI  - Nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxide ultrathin nanosheets coated on reduced graphene oxide nonosheets/nickel foam for high performance asymmetric supercapacitors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Here in, for the first time, we report a new and simple procedure for preparing reduced graphene oxide/nickel-cobalt double layered hydroxide composite on the nickel foam (Ni-Co LDH/rGO/NF) via a fast and simple two-step electrochemical method including potentiostatic routes in the presence of CTAB as a cationic surfactant. Graphene oxide coated nickel foam prepared by simple immersion method. After that, the prepared electrode reduced electrochemically to obtain rGO/NF electrode. Finally, the rGO/NF electrode was used as cathode for electrodeposition of Ni-Co LDH in the presence of CTAB as cationic surfactant. The prepared electrodes were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) and electrochemical techniques such as voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge curves (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The resulting electrode which prepared in the presence of CTAB afforded extremely high specific capacitance of 2133.3 F g(-1) at a current density of 4 A g(-1). FE-SEM, TEM and EDS mapping results showed that Ni-Co LDH nanosheets uniformly covered the surface of rGO/NF in the presence of CTAB, and is closely packed and thinner in thickness compared with the sample prepared in similar way without using surfactant. Such new thin and dense morphology facilitates electrolyte ions diffusion through the prepared electrode. A good cycling stability was obtained for the electrode in alkaline media. EIS measurements showed low values of internal resistance (R-s) and charge transfer resistance (R-ct), indicating that the prepared nanocomposite is a promising candidate for super capacitor applications. The asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) based on the Ni-Co LDH/CTAB/rGO/NF as a positive electrode and rGO/NF as a negative electrode was assembled and it exhibited a C-s of 71.4 F g(-1) at a current density of 2 A/g and correspondingly energy density of as high as 68 Wh kg(-1).

AB  - Rational design and synthesis of core-shell bimetallic nanoparticles with tailored structural and functional properties is highly sought to realize clean and energy-efficient fuel cell systems. Herein, Pd-Au bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) with core-shell morphology (Pd-Core-Au-Shell) were fabricated on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) support by a facile two-step protocol. In the first step, Pd-Core-Ag-Shell bimetallic NPs were synthesized on RGO support by reducing Pd(2+)and Ag+ ions with methyl ammonia borane (MeAB). Later, Pd-Core-Au-Shell bimetallic NPs were conveniently fabricated on RGO support via a galvanic replacement strategy involving sacrificial oxidation of metallic silver and reduction of gold ions. The resulting core/shell bimetallic NPs were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) and cyclic voltrammetry (CV). The electrocatalytic performance of core/shell nanostructures for the room temperature oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media were systematically performed by CV. The electrode-area-normalized ORR activity of RGO-supported Pd-Core-Au-Shell NPs was higher than the corresponding commercially available carbon-supported Pt nanoparticles (Pt/C) at -0.8 V vs Ag/AgCl (satd. KCl) (6.24 vs 5.34 mA cm(-2), respectively). Further, methanol-tolerant ORR activities of as-synthesized catalysts were also studied. The Au-on-Pd/RGO bimetallic NPs presented enhanced ORR activity both in presence and in the absence of methanol in comparison with a commercial Pt/C catalyst and as-synthesized Pd/RGO and Au/RGO catalysts. The enhanced catalytic activities of core/shell structures might be resulted owing to the optimized core/shell structure comprising of a small Pd core and a thin Au shell and synergistic effects offered by Pd and Au. The present synthesis protocol demonstrated for two-layer structure can be extended to multi-layered structures with desired functions and activities. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Synthetical catalysis of nickel and graphene on enhanced hydrogen storage properties of magnesium
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Reduced graphene-oxide-supported nickel (Ni@rGO) nanocomposite catalysts were synthesized, and incorporated into magnesium (Mg) hydrogen storage materials with the aim of improving the hydrogen storage properties of these materials. The experimental results revealed that the catalytic effect of the Ni@rGO nanocomposite on Mg was more effective than that of single nickel (Ni) nanoparticles or graphene. When heated at 100 degrees C, the Mg-Ni and Mg-Ni@rGO composites absorbed 4.70 wt% and 5.48 wt% of H-2, respectively, whereas the pure Mg and Mg@rGO composite absorbed almost no hydrogen. The addition of the Ni@rGO composite as a catalyst yielded significant improvement in the hydrogen storage property of the Mg hydrogen storage materials. The apparent activation energy of the pure Mg sample (i.e., 163.9 kJ mol(-1)) decreased to 139.7 kJ mol(-1) and 123.4 kJ mol(-1) respectively, when the sample was modified with single rGO or Ni nanoparticles. Under the catalytic action of the Ni@rGO nanocomposites, the value decreased further to 103.5 kJ mol(-1). The excellent hydrogen storage properties of the Mg-Ni@rGO composite were attributed to the catalytic effects of the highly surface-active Ni nanoparticles and the unique structure of the composite nanosheets.

M3  - Article
AB  - A phytic acid-derived Co2-xNixP2O7-C/RGO composite was designed and facilely synthesized, in which phytic acid acted as both a phosphoric source and carbon source. Both carbon derived from phytic acid and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) in composite, enhanced the conductivity and thus improve its electrocatalytical capability. As synthesized Co1.22Ni0.78P2O7-C/RGO composite exhibited excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performances: At the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), only a low overpotential of 283 mV and a small Tafel slope of 51 mV dec(-1) were observed. Good OER catalytic performance was retained even after 10 h continuously running at a constant voltage, which is even comparable to those of first-rate noble metal catalyst RuO2. In addition, the performances of Co2-xNixP2O7-C/RGO catalysts were also strongly dependent on Ni content. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

M3  - Article
AB  - Ternary nanocomposites of Ag-ZnO-rGO were prepared through an in-situ hydrothermal process in presence of 1, 8-diamino-3, 6-dioxaoctan (DDO). It was tried to result homoge-neous fine particles by changing the effective parameters. Then, photocatalytic perfor-mance of the optimized sample was investigated by removing Rhodamine B (RhB) dye as an organic pollutant. Next, the photocatalytic efficiency was optimized by two operational parameters: concentration of dye and pH of solution. On the other sides, the results showed that the silver content amount in the composite can affect the photocatalytic yield. Therefore, ideal efficiency (98.92%) was obtained when the concentration of RhB solution was 10 ppm and pH was adjusted to 11, in the presence of Ag-ZnO-rGO nanocomposite with a silver content of about 5%. According to the findings, DDO can be considered an important agent for the synthesis of Ag-ZnO-rGO nanocomposite which should be used as a photocatalyst.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - A simple spray assisted method to fabricate high performance layered graphene/silicon hybrid anodes for lithium-ion batteries
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Incorporating silicon (Si) in anodes has shown great promise for the development of high capacity Li-ion batteries (LIBs). Moreover, it is a safe and environmentally benign material, and hence suitable for large-scale manufacturing. However, volumetric expansion of Si particles upon lithiation causes irreversible damage to the anode structure and promotes an unstable solid electrolyte interface (SEI), that cause a rapid capacity drop. The architecture of successful Si-based anodes, therefore, needs to cater to the large volumetric expansion such that the high specific capacity of Si can be taken advantage of without having to worry about the detrimental effects of expansion. In this study, we introduce a simple and cost-effective spray-drying method to fabricate a layered (sandwich-like) anode structure using synthesized Si nanoparticles (NPs) and thermally reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The Si NPs are obtained by the magnesiothermic reduction of SiO2 nanoparticles. Using an original, scalable, and simplistic spraying/drying method, we embedded Si NPs between two coats of strong yet flexible rGO sheets. The sandwich-like structure, which successfully contains the expansion of Si particles, protects the anode from detrimental conditions. With this new and uncomplicated production technique, the rGO-Si-rGO anode after 50 cycles, shows a high specific capacity of 1089 mAhg(-1) at 1C with 97% coulombic efficiency and a stable cycling performance at current densities up to 5C.

AB  - The exploration of highly active and stable nonprecious electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is of great significance for the advancement of diverse sustainable energy storage and conversion systems. Herein, we demonstrate a facile one-pot hydro thermal synthesis of ultrafine and monodisperse NiS/NiS2 heteronanoparticles (ca. 3.2 nm) uniformly in situ grown on N-doped reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (denoted as NiS/NiS2@N-rGO hereafter). In such unique NiS/NiS2@N-rGO sample, the tiny-sized NiS/NiS2 heteronanoparticles with abundant intimate interfacial contacts allow the effective modification of the electronic structure and more exposure of catalytically active sites. Moreover, the conductive N-rGO support could serve as a "highway" of in-plane charge transfer and facilitate the mass diffusion during the electrocatalytic process. As a consequence, the resultant NiS/NiS2@N-rGO catalyst exhibits a superior HER performance with an overpotential of 148 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution. The NiS/NiS2CPN-rGO catalyst could also endure long-term operation for 12 h with negligible activity attenuation and morphological change. The present study provides a feasible approach to explore efficient and robust non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts for a variety of renewable electrochemical applications.

TI  - Supported bimetallic nanoparticles as anode catalysts for direct methanol fuel cells: A review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) is an environment friendly energy source that transforms chemical energy of methanol oxidation into electrical energy. The Pt- and non-Pt based bimetallic nanoparticles (BMNPs) with electrocatalyst support materials are employed as anode electrocatalysts for methanol oxidation. These supported BMNPs have drawn prominent consideration due to their incredible physical and chemical properties. This article reviews the advancements in the field of supported BMNPs of varied structures, compositions and morphologies, using innumerable carbonaceous support materials such as carbon black, carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, graphene, mesoporous carbon as well as non-carbonaceous supports like inorganic oxides, graphitic carbon nitride, metal nitrides, conducting polymers and hybrid support materials. The performance of electrocatalysts on the basis of support material, structure, composition and morphology of BMNPs, and pros and cons of various support materials have been discussed.(c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - An efficient photocatalytic system containing Eosin Y, 3D mesoporous graphene assembly and CuO for visible-light-driven H-2 evolution from water
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present work, 3D mesoporous graphene assembly was fabricated in a hydrothermal process using triethylenetetramine molecules as cross-linkers. And CuO nanoparticles were introduced in the graphene assembly via in-situ photodeposition. Then, a photocatalytic system containing Eosin Y as a sensitizer, graphene assembly as a supporter material and electron transfer channel, and CuO nanoparticles as an active center of H-2 evolution from water was prepared. Meanwhile, photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water over the as prepared photocatalytic system was explored under visible irradiation. Furthermore, for practical purposes, the durability of the photocatalytic system was also studied. And the photocatalytic mechanism was preliminarily discussed. The experimental results indicate that the as-prepared photocatalytic system is an efficient photocatalyst for visible-light driven H-2 evolution from water. The rate of H-2 evolution over the photocatalytic system is up to 5.85 mmol g(-1) h(-1) under optimal conditions, which is 2.3 times higher than that over reduced graphene oxide loaded with CuO. The 3D porous graphene assembly plays an important role in the photocatalytic process. It can not only efficiently enhance the electron transfer in the photocatalytic system, but also result in fast diffusion of sacrificial reagent and timely release of H-2 bubbles. This work provides us with new possibility for designing an efficient Pt-free visible photocatalyst for H-2 evolution from water. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Reduced graphene oxide supported hierarchical flower like manganese oxide as efficient electrocatalysts toward reduction and evolution of oxygen
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The slow kinetics of the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a major bottleneck for the development of alkaline fuel cells. Herein, a facile and effective hydro thermal route has been developed to synthesize hierarchical with controllable structures of manganese oxides (Mn2O3) and reduced graphene oxides supported Mn2O3 composites. The hierarchal metal oxides were formed by self-assembly of very small Mn2O3 nanoparticles as evident from transmission electron microscopy. The nature of chelating agents has found to be the key factor whose subtle variation can effectively control the morphology of the Mn2O3. Electrochemical investigations indicate that the both pure and supported Mn2O3 demonstrate bifunctional catalytic activity toward the four-electron electrochemical reduction of oxygen and evolution reaction in alkaline media. Due to the 3D assembled hierarchical architecture of Mn2O3 composed of rose- and petal-like nano-particle arrays and the interconnection of reduced graphene oxides (rGO) network, as well as the synergetic effects of rGO as a support, revealing the pronounce impact on the electrocatalytic activity the Mn2O3 composites with high current density and excellent durability as cathode material which is comparable with other electrocatalysts. The synthetic approach provides a general platform for fabricating well-defined pure and supported metal oxides with prospective applications as low-cost catalysts for alkaline fuel cells.

TI  - Synthesis and characterization of GO-PpPDA/Ni-Mn nanocomposite as a novel catalyst for methanol electrooxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The graphene oxide-poly (p-phenylene diamine) (GP) composite is synthesized through insitu polymerization of p-phenylene diamine on GO sheets and used as an efficient support material for electrodeposition of Ni and Mn. The resulting GP/NieMn catalyst shows high catalytic activity, stability and durability for methanol electrooxidation. The surface area of GP composite is calculated to be about 28% and 36% higher than GO and PpPDA, respectively. In addition, combining Ni and Mn demonstrated some synergetic effect for methanol electrooxidation. The electrochemical active surface area of GP/NieMn is about 1.625 cm(2), which is much higher than GP/Ni and GP/Mn. GP/NieMn nanocomposite presented 87.3% of the peak current after 5 h and almost 83.16% of the maximum current for 500 cycles. The excellent characteristics of this composite are attributed to high surface area, high electrochemical active surface area and fine distribution of metallic particles on the support material.

CP  - International Conference on Sustainable Environment and Energy (ICSEE)
CL  - Hindustan Univ, Chennai, INDIA
AB  - Bimetallic PtPd nanospheres strongly fabricated on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets (rGO-PtPd) by simple one pot wet reflux method for superior methanol electro-oxidation. There is no any other polymer or seed involved for preparation of nanocomposite. The as-synthesized materials structure and morphology was calibrated by Powdered X-ray diffraction (P-XRD), Raman, X-ray photo electron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The PtPd nanoparticles supported rGO sheets displays superior electro-catalytic activity and stability towards methanol electro-oxidation (MOR) because of their large electrochemical surface area (ECSA, which is 1.68 times greater than that of commercial Pt/C black) and synergistic effect of the bimetallic alloy. The rGO-PtPd showed enhanced electro-catalytic performances towards MOR in acidic media due to particle size and uniform distribution of particles, which rGO-Pt1Pd1 (Pt/Pd molar ratio 1/1) showed the more specific activity, mass activity and stability for MOR. Thus, as-synthesized rGO-PtPd catalyst could apply potential applications in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) to lower their cost and advance their cycle ability, which make it promising for practical catalysis in energy conversion and storage.

TI  - ORR performance evaluation of Al-substituted MnFe2O4/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Active and durable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts are of utmost importance to realize the commercialization of hydrogen fuel cells and metal-air batteries. Al-substituted MnFe2O4-based ternary oxide and reduced graphene oxide (MAF-RGO) nanocomposite is synthesized using an in-situ co-precipitation followed by a hydrothermal process and verified for ORR electrocatalysis in the alkaline electrolyte (0.1 M KOH). MAF-RGO is first analyzed using physicochemical characterization tools including X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, sorption studies, electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, etc. Further, the characteristic ORR peak centered at 0.56 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies confirms the electrocatalytic performance of MAF-RGO. The ORR onset potential of 0.92 V vs. RHE is obtained in linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurement at 1600 rpm in O-2-saturated electrolyte exhibiting an improved ORR performance as compared to the commercial electrocatalyst. The reduction kinetics is observed to follow the desirable near 4-e(-) mechanism. In addition, the electrocatalyst exhibits improved relative current stability of 86% and methanol poisoning resistance of 82%, which is better in comparison to the standard Pt/C. The observed electrochemical performance results from the synergism between the oxygen vacancy-rich Al-substituted metallic oxide active species and the functional group enriched predominantly mesoporous RGO sheets with excellent electrical conductivity. The introduction of metallic species enhanced the inter-planar spacing between graphitic sheets easing the maneuver of reactant species through the electrocatalyst and accessing more ORR-active sites. This study establishes the potency of mixed transition metal oxide/nanocarbon composites as durable high-performance ORR-active systems. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - PtRu nanoalloys loaded on graphene and TiO2 nanotubes co-modified Ti wire as an active and stable methanol oxidation electrocatalyst
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Highly active, durable and scalable fuel cell electrocatalysts are highly desirable but challenging. Herein, we first develop a novel catalyst of PtRu nanoalloys loaded on graphene modified anodic TiO2 nanotubes arrays (TNTs) grown on flexible Ti wires (denoted as PtRu/RGO/TNTs). Electrodeposited reduced graphene oxide (RGO) is used to improve the electric conductivity and facilitate the dispersion of PtRu nanoparticles. TiO2 nanotubes arrays could guarantee the large surface area, and PtRu nanoalloys are well-dispersed on the inner and external walls of the TNTs as well as the RGO surface, which could facilitate the fast mass transport and enhanced electrocatalytic activity. PtRu nanoalloys with intimate contact between the two metals is conductive to remove the harmful CO-like byproduct, resulting in superior tolerance to CO poisoning. In addition, this work first design and use the spirally flexible Ti wire electrode configuration in direct methanol fuel cell, which shows a highly efficient catalytic performance. Moreover, this kind of catalytic support is a strong candidate for other electrochemical energy conversion devices. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Pt-Ni nanoparticles electrodeposited on rGO/CFP as high-performance integrated electrode for methanol oxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel carbon fiber paper loaded with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was used as the substrate, on which Pt-Ni nanoparticles were electro-deposited as to prepare an integrated electrode by two electrochemical methods (cyclic voltammetry and square wave pulse). The electrochemical tests indicated two integrated electrodes had excellent performance towards methanol oxidation. Especially, Pt-Ni-CV(A)-rGO/CFP electrode showed the high-est electrocatalytic activity, and mass activity reached 5.33 A$mg?1Pt, which was about 5.6 times that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst (JM). Further, after annealing under a reducing atmosphere, two electrodes exhibited completely different changes in the aspects of morphology and electrocatalytic performance. It can be attributed to the changes of element distribution and morphology of nanoparticles after annealing. The as-prepared Pt-Ni-rGO/CFPs composite electrode is promising for integrated electrode of proton ex-change membrane fuel cells. This work opens an avenue for the preparation of high-performance integrated electrode.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Transition metal oxides are nowadays one of the most important materials in the manufacture of capacitive electrodes. The most important problems with these materials for applied energy storage devices are low specific energy and poor electrical conductivity. In this research nickel ferrite nanoparticles (NiFe2O4) and also hybrid of NiFe2O4/rGO are synthesized by hydrothermal method and characterized by XRD, Raman, and XPS analysis. The amount of porosity and specific surface area is studied by BET analysis as and surface morphology is studied by SEM and TEM. To investigate the effect of adding rGO to NiFe2O4 nanoparticles, from a hybrid electrode superconducting electrochemical tests are performed, including CV, EIS, and charge-discharge. This electrode with a capacitance of 584.63 F/g and capacitance retention of 91% after 2000 consecutive cycles can be a tempting option for supercapacitor applications.

AB  - Sulfonic acid groups were introduced onto graphene oxide (GO) via sulfonation reaction to prepare sulfonated graphene oxide (SG). Then, zincoxysulfide-SG composite photo catalysts were prepared by mixing SG and zincoxysulfide (ZnS1-xOx) nanoparticles. The morphology, crystalline properties, bandgap, and photocatalytic H-2 production activity of these photocatalysts were investigated by FESEM, XRD, Mott-Schottky plots, and H-2 production tests. The photocatalytic H-2 production rates of Ce-doped zincoxysulfide SG photocatalyst under UV and visible light irradiation reach 2100 and 700 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), respectively. The improved H-2 evolution activity of Ce-doped zincoxysulfide SG composite photocatalysts can be attributed to the strong interaction between SG sheets and zincoxysulfide nanoparticles. By introducing sulfonated graphene oxide and Ce-doping, SG zincoxysulfide photocatalysts exhibit stable and high photocatalytic H-2 production activity, resulting from increased specific surface area, efficient charge separation, decreased bandgap and enhanced light absorption. After 3 cycles, the photocatalytic activity of recycled C2ZG2 photocatalyst remains at about 93.8% of its original activity. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

CP  - 2nd International Conference on Sustainable Environment and Energy (ICSEE)
CL  - Chennai, INDIA
AB  - In quest of finding a sustainable solution for metal-free counter electrode materials, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is emerged as the best alternative due to its intrinsic high electrocatalytic activity. However, owing to its two-dimensional sheets like structure, there is re-stacking of rGO sheets, which reduces exposed surface area and hinders in electrolyte diffusion. To avoid these issues, activated charcoal (AC) is explored as an active spacer material between rGO sheets, for the first time. By loading an optimum concentration of AC in rGO, a high porosity, high conductivity, and high concentration of active sites were gathered in the single composite structure. Such synchronized features of the proposed composite were utilized for Pt-free counter electrode application in dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSc). The composite structure showed high electrocatalytic activity, with a low charge transfer resistance of 0.7 Omega, which is far lower than Pt and rGO (8.5 Omega and 7.5 Omega). The DSSc fabricated with optimized composite showed power conversion efficiency of 8.6%, compared to Pt-based DSSc with 7.9% efficiency. Additionally, the potential of the electrode was also tested for the electro-photocatalytic (99%) degradation of methylene blue dye from water, in 60 min. The proposed highly efficient nanocomposite structure possesses the highest efficiency as compared to other previously studied rGO based counter electrodes. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Cobalt phosphide nanoparticles embedded in 3D N-doped porous carbon for efficient hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - An electrocatalyst based on a unique three-dimensional (3D) N-doped porous carbon sheet networks embedded with CoP2 nanoparticles (CoP2@3D-NPC) was synthesized by a facile pyrolysis process as well as an in-situ phosphatization method. The improved CoP2@3D-NPC hybrid materials show excellent electrocatalytic activity toward HER and OER. This material provides a low overpotential of 126 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 167 mV at 20 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH for HER with a small Tafel slope value of 59 mV dec(-1), respectively. Besides, it is also active for the OER under alkaline conditions. Such a prominent property of the CoP2@3D-NPC electrocatalyst could be attributed to its excellent electrical conductivity of 3D carbon substrate, strong synergistic effect between CoP2 nanoparticles and carbon nanosheet as well as extra active sites created by the N-doped structure.

TI  - Reduced graphene oxide-modified vanadium tetrasulfide serves as an excellent catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Transition metal sulfides are widely recognized as energy storage materials. An efficient and stable composite catalyst rGO-modified VS4 for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was synthesized by hydrothermal method. The structure, morphology, composition, and catalytic activity of the catalyst were detected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectra, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electrochemical methods. The results show a strong bond cooperation between VS4 and rGO that is in favor of the transfer of electrons during the catalytic process. Therefore, the composite catalyst possesses superior ORR activity, methanol tolerance, and long-time durability. This work provides a useful exploration for the development of inexpensive, efficient, and stable alternative catalysts for Pt/C. (c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Facile gamma radiolytic methodology for TiO2-rGO synthesis: Effect on photo-catalytic H-2 evolution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - TiO2 (P25) decorated reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is synthesized by gamma-radiolytic technique using water-ethanol solvent medium. Visible light absorpdon was confirmed by UV-Visible spectroscopy. Photoluminescence (PL) study revealed a decline in electron-hole recombination rate signalled by a sharp fall in luminescence of TiO2. Under such scenario, electron transfer from TiO2 conduction band to the conjugated sheet becomes a preferred pathway in the presence of rGO, which is further confirmed by photocurrent measurement. TiO2 -rGO composite with 1 wt. % rGO was found to be the best composition in terms of visible light absorption, while retaining TiO2 crystallinity. Transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopic studies confirmed the coating of rGO sheet with TiO2 nanoparticles. TiO2 -rGO was found to show about 150 times higher photocatalytic H-2 generation under 250 W UV-Visible light irradiation than pristine TiO2. In addition to this, TiO2 -rGO composite shows hydrogen production yield of 35 mu mol/h.g under visible light (lambda = 400 nm) irradiation. Thus gamma-radiolysis can be considered to be a viable technique, which helps in synthesizing photocatalytically active nanocomposite with high H-2 evolution rate. In the light of these interesting aspects, a detail investigation is carried out to study the effect of rGO concentration and illumination time on photocatalytic yield.

TI  - Efficient hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane over ultrafine Ru nanoparticles supported on biomass-derived porous carbon
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ammonia borane hydrolysis is a promising strategy for developing sustainable hydrogen energy. However, this reaction is not kinetically feasible at ambient temperature, thus developing a proper catalyst is indispensable. In this work, Porous carbon is facilely prepared from cattail fibers by using K2CO3, and then used to stabilize Ru nanoparticles. The effects of different synthesis parameters for the biomass-derived carbon supports (e. g. K2CO3 dosage and calcination temperature) and various catalytic reaction conditions (e. g. the amounts of the catalysts, ammonia borane and NaOH, and reaction temperature) on the hydrolysis rate of ammonia borane are investigated. Benefitting from the interconnected hierarchical pores of the optimal porous carbon (p-C), which was prepared with a mass ratio of 6 : 1 for K2CO3 to cattail fibers and calcined at 873 K, and the high dispersion of Ru nanoparticles, the optimal Ru/p-C catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance. The corresponding apparent activation energy (28.8 kJ mol(-1)) and turnover frequency 744.7 min(-1) in alkaline solution) are superior to many catalysts previously reported. This work offers a competitive catalyst for the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of chemical hydrogen storage materials. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - rGO supported PdNi-CeO2 nanocomposite as an efficient catalyst for hydrogen evolution from the hydrolysis of NH3BH3
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The hydrogen economy is a proposed system that utilizes hydrogen to deliver energy. For the realization of this concept, how to safely, controllably and reversibly store and release hydrogen are critical problems which must be resolved. Metal alloys combined with suitable support materials are widely applied to various catalytic reactions. Here palladium nickel bimetallic nanoparticles doped with cerium oxide on a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) support were prepared by combining metal ion precursors and graphene oxide in a one-pot co-reduction approach. The as-received catalysts were characterized by XRD, TEM, SEM, XPS and ICP-OES, and the results revealed that PdNi-CeO2 nanoparticles were uniform dispersal on rGO. The as-synthesized PdNi-CeO2/rGO had been adopted as a heterogeneous catalyst for the hydrogen evolution from the hydrolysis of ammonia borane (NH3BH3, AB) at room temperature. Kinetically, the hydrogen-release rate was first-order with the increased concentration of catalysts. The optimized catalyst of Pd0.8Ni0.2-CeO2/rGO with the CeO2 content of 13.9 mol% exhibited an excellent activity with a turnover frequency value of 30.5 mol H-2 (mol catalyst)(-1) min(-1) at 298 K, and a low apparent activation energy (E-a) of 37.78 kJ mol(-1). The robust catalytic performance of the Pd0.8Ni0.2-CeO2/rGO is attributed to the uniform controlled nanoparticle size, the synergic effect between the nanoparticles bimetallic properties, and the effective charge transfer interactions between the metal and support.

TI  - Simultaneous hydrogen generation and COD reduction in a photoanode-based microbial electrolysis cell
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A phenolic precursor-based carbon film dispersed with cerium oxide (CeO2) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is prepared as the electrodes of a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) for simultaneous hydrogen (H-2) production and reduction of chemical oxygen demand (COD) in wastewater under visible light irradiation. The oxides are in situ dispersed in the polymerization reaction mixture during the synthesis stage of the phenolic film. The maximum Coulombic energy efficiency, overall H-2 recovery and cathodic recovery of the CeO2-rGO/carbon film-based MEC are measured to be approximately 95, 93 and 98%, respectively at 1 V (Ag/ AgCl), whereas COD reduction in the wastewater is measured to be approximately 95%. The improved hydrogen evolution and organic degradation are attributed to the electroconductive graphitic rGO and photocatalytic CeO2, respectively. The metal oxide-rGO-dispersed carbon nanocomposite film-based MEC provides an efficient means for simultaneously producing H-2 and treating the organics-laden wastewater.

TI  - Facile synthesis of ZnFe2O4@RGO nanocomposites towards photocatalytic ciprofloxacin degradation and H-2 energy production
T2  - JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The production of Hydrogen energy through the splitting of water is a promising pathway for clean environment and sustainability. Herein we have synthesized a series of ZnFe2O4 (ZFO)@Reduced Graphene Oxide (RGO) nanocomposites by hydrothermal followed by calcination method and studied its application towards hydrogen energy production and ciprofloxacin degradation. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) study and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis indicate the good crystallinity and suitable chemical environment for the photocatalytic process. Among all the samples, ZFO@3%RGO showed 73.4% of CIP degradation under solar irradiation of 1 h, which is 1.67 times higher than that of pure ZFO nanoparticles. CIP degradation process follows first order kinetics with a good rate constant of 0.021 min(-1) which is 2.3 times greater than ZFO. The photocatalyst ZFO@3%RGO illustrated maximum H-2 energy production i.e. 410.32 mu mol/h, which is 1.35 times more than that of neat ZFO nanoparticles. ZFO@3%RGO demonstrates the highest photocurrent density of 0.6 mA/cm(2) under light illuminations, which is 250 times superior to that of the pristine photocatalyst. Bode phase analysis confirmed that ZFO@RGO shows 13 times higher charge separation efficiency in comparison to neat ZFO. The best photocatalytic activity of ZFO@3%RGO nanocomposite is due to its high light absorption capacity, low photogenerated exciton recombination, high electron-hole separation, and high photocurrent density.

TI  - Pd nanoparticles support on rGO-C@TiC coaxial nanowires as a novel 3D electrode for NaBH4 electrooxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, direct borohydride fuel cell (DBFC) has been considering as a promising energy conversion devices. During the development of DBFC, reducing the use of noble metals and increasing the anode performance are the hot topic in recent researches. In this article, reduced graphene oxide nanosheets deposit on C@TiC coaxial nanowire array (rGO-C@TiC) by means of a combine method of chemical vapor deposition and electrodeposition is chosen as 3D current collector for Pd nanoparticles deposition. The morphology and crystal structure of the as-obtained 3D electrode is checked with FESEM, TEM, EDS, and XRD. Results claim that the as-prepared 3D electrode exhibits a mushroom-like structure with the mean diameter size of Pd is 5.32 nm. Their catalytic ability for NaBH4 electro-oxidation is evaluated in a three electrode system by using the method of cycle voltammetry and chronoamperometry, proving that the 3D Pd-rGO-C@TiC electrode has a higher catalytic performance. The oxidation current density of 1.35 A cm(-2) mg(pd)(-1) is achieved at-0.6 V. Furthermore, a direct borohydride-hydrogen peroxide fuel cell (DBHPFC) is assembled by using the as-prepared Pd-rGO-C@TiC electrode and a Pd/CFC electrode as anode and cathode catalyst, respectively, and a maximum power density of 68.5 mW cm(-2) is obtained. In addition, the assembled DBHPFC shows excellent higher performance based on the mass activity basis (1427.1 W g(-1)) among those reported literatures, indicating that our Pd-rGO-C@TiC could be acted as a promising cost-effective and ponderable alternative catalyst for NaBH4 electrooxidation.

TI  - Enhanced methanol oxidation on PtNi nanoparticles supported on silane-modified reduced graphene oxide
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing low cost, highly efficient, and long-term stability electrocatalysts are critical for direct oxidation methanol fuel cell. Despite huge efforts, designing low-cost electrocatalysts with high activity and long-term durability remains a significant technical challenge. Here, we prepared a new kind of platinum-nickel catalyst supported on silane-modified graphene oxide (NH2-rGO) by a two-step method at room temperature. Powder X-ray diffraction, UV-vis spectroscopy, Raman, FTIR spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results confirm that GO was successfully modified with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), which helps to uniformly disperse PtNi nanoparticles. Cyclic voltammetry, chro-noamperometry, CO-stripping and rotating disk electrode (RDE) results imply that PtNi/NH2-rGO catalyst has significantly higher catalytic activity, enhance the CO toxicity resistance, higher stability and much faster kinetics of methanol oxidation than commercial Pt/C under alkaline conditions.

TI  - A facile fabrication of functionalized rGO crosslinked chemically stable polysulfone-based anion exchange membranes with enhanced performance
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introducing more ionic conductive groups in polymer-based anion exchange membranes (AEMs) can improve the ion exchange capacity and further overcome the disadvantage of low ion conductivity for AEMs. However, the excessive swelling of AEMs caused by exorbitant IEC value may reduce the dimensional stability of membranes. So it is extremely important to modify the structures of AEMs. Herein, we proposed a facile strategy to construct reduced graphene oxide (rGO) stable crosslinked polysulfone-based AEMs with improved properties. rGO was non-covalently modified with pyrene-containing tertiary amine small molecule and polymer via pi-pi interactions. The as-prepared functionalized rGO (TrGO and PrGO) as both cross-linkers and fillers to fabricate quaternized polysulfone (QPSU)-based AEMs (CQPSU-X-TrGO and CQPSU-X-PrGO) for the first time. The cross-linked membranes can tighten the internal packing structure, and enhance the alkaline resistance, ion conductivity and oxidative stability of AEMs. Furthermore, the hydrophilicity and flexibility of the CQPSU-X-PrGO membranes were significantly improved as compared with that of CQPSU-X-TrGO membranes. PrGO-crosslinked membranes (CQPSU-2%-PrGO, sigma(OH) = 117.7 mS/cm) displayed higher ionic conductivities at 80 degrees C than TrGO-crosslinked membranes (CQPSU-1%-TrGO, sigma((O) over barH) = 87.2 mS/cm). The remarkable nanophase separation can be observed in the CQPSU-X-PrGO membranes by TEM. This feasible strategy can be efficiently used to prepare new type of crosslinked organic-inorganic nanohybrid AEMs with excellent chemical stability and high ionic conductivity.

TI  - Enhanced performance of Pt and Pt-Ru supported PEDOT-RGO nanocomposite towards methanol oxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The electrocatalytic performance of reduced graphene oxide-poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/platinum (RGO-PEDOT/Pt) nanocomposite for methanol oxidation has been evaluated with respect to PEDOT/Pt and RGO/Pt. The electrocatalysts are characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The RGO-PEDOT/Pt has been found to have favorable characteristics in terms of large specific surface area (460.5 m(2) g(-1)) and small particle size (0.61 nm). The methanol oxidation current for RGO-PEDOT/Pt is nearly 3.6 and 12.6 times higher than that for PEDOT/Pt and RGO/Pt respectively. Among the three electrocatalysts, the RGO-PEDOT/Pt nanocomposite shows the best electrocatalytic behavior towards methanol oxidation with a mass specific peak current of 774 mA mg(-1) cm(-2) for a Pt loading of 191.4 mu g cm(-2) at a concentration of 1 M methanol in 0.5 M H2SO4. The effects of Pt loading, methanol concentration and electrode stability have been studied. RGO-PEDOT/Pt-Ru electrodes with a fixed Pt and variable Ru ion concentrations are prepared by chronoamperometry and the Pt-Ru alloy formation was confirmed by X-ray diffraction method. The electrocatalytic performance of the Pt-Ru supported RGO-PEDOT for the oxidation of methanol is evaluated by cyclic voltammetry. The Tafel kinetic analysis indicates that the RGO-PEDOT/Pt-Ru prepared with equal concentrations of Pt and Ru ions (i.e. RGO-PEDOT/Pt-Ru (1:1)) gives the best performance in terms of the lowest onset potential (0.14 V), highest exchange current density (2390 mu A cm(-2)) and highest I-f/I-r ratio (2.33) implying minimum poisoning.

TI  - Nitrogen-phosphorus co-functionalized reduced graphene oxide supported NiCoPd-CeOx nanoparticles as a highly efficient and stable catalyst for formic acid dehydrogenation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Formic acid (HCOOH, FA), a common liquid hydrogen storage material, has attracted tremendous research interest. However, the development of efficient, low-cost and high stable heterogeneous catalyst for selective dehydrogenation of FA remains a major challenge. In this paper, a simple co-reduction method is proposed to synthesize nitrogen phosphorus co-functionalized rGO (NPG) supported ultrafine NiCoPd-CeOx nanoparticles (NPs) with a mean size of 1.2 nm. Remarkably, the as-prepared Ni0.2Co0.2Pd0.6-CeOx/NPG shows outstanding catalytic activity for FA dehydrogenation, affording a high TOF value of 6506.8 mol H2 mol Pd-1 h(-1) at 303 K and a low activation energy of 17.7 kJ mol(-1), which is better than most of the reported heterogeneous catalysts, and can be ascribed to the combined effect of well-dispersed ultrafine NiCoPd-CeOx NPs, modified Pd electronic structure, and abundant active sites. The reaction mechanism of dehydrogenation of FA is also discussed. Furthermore, the optimized Ni0.2Co0.2Pd0.6-CeOx/NPG shows excellent stability over 10th run with 100% conversion and 100% H-2 selectivity, which may provide more possibilities for practical application of FA system on fuel cells.

TI  - Facile synthesis of C-Ta4+ co-doped NaTaO3 and rGO nanocomposites with enhanced visible light photocatalytic performance
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nanocomposites of C-Ta4+ co-doped NaTaO3 and reduced graphene oxide (C-NTO/rGO) with highly efficient photocatalytic activity were fabricated by a one-step solvothermal reaction. The optimum composites C-NTO/3rGO (with 3 wt% rGO) exhibited superior photocatalytic activity for the degradation of RhB over a mono-component counterpart under visible light irradiation. The photocatalytic efficiency was found to be as high as 97% for 90 min. Both XRD and XPS characterizations indicated that the doping of carbon into the NaTaO3 lattice leads to the reduction of Ta5+ to Ta4+. Furthermore, the co-doping significantly narrows the band gap (about 2.8 eV). Photo-luminescence (PL), time resolved transient PL decay spectra and photo-current results confirmed that photo-induced hole electron pairs can be effectively separated resulting from the introduction of rGO. The synergistic effect of a decreased band gap and highly effective separation of photo generated electrons and holes may be responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the fabricated nanocomposites. Both h+ and & BULL;OH active radicals were found to be the key factors for the photo-decomposition process of RhB over the nanocomposites, while , O-2(-) was also involved to a smaller extent. A possible photo-degradation mechanism for C-NTO/rGO was proposed on the basis of the experiments results. (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Embedding Co2P nanoparticles into N&P co-doped carbon fibers for hydrogen evolution reaction and supercapacitor
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The demands for highly efficient and low-cost electrochemically active materials are still urgent needs for the fields of electro-catalysis and supercapacitor. Herein, a facile strategy for preparing high-efficient bi-functional electrode material was reported. The electrode material was prepared through embedding Co2P nanoparticles in the binary co-doped carbon nanofibers (Co2P@N&P-CNFs). This unique structure can effectively prevent the Co2P from detaching and provide abundant active sites. Materials prepared in this work showed the superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance with overpotential of 192 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and remarkable stability for 20 h. Moreover, the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was fabricated using the Co2P@N&P-CNFs as the positive electrode material and carbon nanofibers (CNFs) as the negative electrode material, which shows an outstanding cycle stability (91.5% of the initial capacitance is retained throughout 10,000 charge-discharge tests) and a high E of 22.31 Wh kg(-1) at the P of 225.02 W kg(-1) at 0.3 A g(-1). This work offers an effective route in designing bi-functional active materials for HER and supercapacitor. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Enhanced photodegradation toward graphene-based MgFe2O4-TiO2: Investigation and optimization
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, graphene-based MgFe2O4-TiO2 (MFO-TiO2@rCO) nanocomposite was synthesized and conducted an efficient photo-treatment with p-nitrophenol (PNP) as a well -known pollutant in water. The ternary material was characterized by modern analysis methods including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, Transmission electron microscopy, Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Selected area electron diffraction, and UV-vis spectroscopy. The simultaneous effects of the volume of H2O2, catalyst dosage, and pH on the photodegradation of p-nitrophenol were also examined by full factorial experimental design according to Box-Behnken designs. As a result, the characterization has confirmed the uniform bounding of MFO and TiO2 nanosizing from 4 to 6 nm on graphene with a high crystallinity degree. The photocatalysis of this material toward PNP can reach up to -99.44% in only 60 min reaction under UV control with 1.12 mL H2O2 added, 38.15 mg catalyst, and pH 9. Besides, in solar condition (directly under sun), the material also expressed a relatively impressive capability in degrade PNP from water. Furthermore, the ternary nanocomposite can be easily recycled and reused with an inconsiderable change in yield, represented by the elimination yield of recovered MFO-TiO2@rCO was significantly more than 90% after ten-run cycles. Indeed, the nanocomposite suggests an efficient pathway for treating organic contaminants in wastewater treatment. (C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Recent advances in electrochemical nonenzymatic hydrogen peroxide sensors based on nanomaterials: a review
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - The development of efficient electrochemical hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) sensors has received great attention due to the significance of H2O2 in biological systems and its practical applications in various fields. With the new class of H2O2 sensors, the nonenzymatic detection of the target can provide many attractive characteristics, such as simple fabrication, ultrahigh sensitivity, and excellent stability. Considering the rapid expansion of nonenzymatic H2O2 detection using advanced nanomaterials, an overview of the current state of methods for electrochemical nonenzymatic H2O2 sensors is presented (with 399 refs.). The first part of the review covers the sensors based on the use of nanoparticles consisting of metals, metal oxides/sulfides, and bimetallic nanoparticles/alloys. The next major section discusses sensors that make use of carbon nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, graphene oxide, carbon dots, and of other carbonaceous materials. Advantages and the intrinsic drawbacks of employing various nanomaterials to detect H2O2 are emphasized.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper reports on the biosynthesis, characterization and catalytic activity of silver (Ag) nanoparticles (NPs) supported on the reduced graphene oxide (Ag/RGO) surface using Abutilon hirtum leaf extract as a reducing and capping agent without using any synthetic reagent or toxic chemicals. Introducing A. hirtum leaf extract into an aqueous mixture of AgNO3 and GO caused the speedy reduction of the GO and silver ions and efficiently lead to their nucleation as highly stable Ag NPs on the RGO surface. The crystalline nature of the Ag/RGO nanocomposite was identified using XRD analysis. The possible mechanism leading to the formation of NPs was developed to illustrate this process. The Ag/RGO nanocomposite was employed as catalyst for the reduction of organic dyes such as 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), Congo red (CR) and Rhodamine B (RhB) in the shortest possible time in water at mild conditions. The catalytic reduction reactions were monitored by employing UV-Vis spectroscopy. Furthermore, the nanocomposite can be recovered and recycled several times without significant loss of activity.

TI  - Nitrogen and sulfur doped ZnAl layered double hydroxide/reduced graphene oxide as an efficient nanoelectrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reactions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, to synthesize an efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR), the combination of N,S-rGO and ZnAl-LDH with several concentrations is studied for the first time. For this purpose, six electrocatalysts including Graphene Oxide (GO), functionalized reduced graphene oxide with nitrogen and sulfur atoms (N,S-rGO), Zinc-Aluminum layered double hydroxides (ZnAl-LDH), and ZnAl-LDH/N,S-rGO hybrids in three weight ratios of 1:1, 1:3, and 1:5 (the weight ratio of N,S-rGO is 1) are synthesized by the hydrothermal method. The physical properties, morphology, and structure of the synthesized electrocatalysts are determined by using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM), Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis (EDX), the Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman analysis. Electrochemical measurements are implemented by using Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), Linear Scanning Voltammetry (LSV), and chronoamperometric. Also, the electron transfer number is calculated by K-L plot. The obtained results for all samples are compared with the % 20 Pt/C commercial catalyst. Based on the results of the physical tests, in addition to the uniform distribution and the correct deposition of the synthesized electrocatalysts, the particle size also reached the nanometer range. According to the electrochemical results, among the synthesized electrocatalysts, the ZnAl-LDH/N,S-rGO with 1:1 wt ratio has the best electrochemical activity. This result indicates a well synergistic and interaction effect between N,S-rGO and ZnAl-LDH for the ORR. The onset potential is obtained to be similar to 0.01 V vs Ag/AgCl. The average of electron transfer number by this electrocatalyst is 3.60, which indicates that it is close to the 4e pathway for the ORR. The electrocatalytic stability was favorable in the alkaline medium. It can be concluded that the Layered Double Hydroxides (LDHs) improve the electrical conductivity, the electrocatalytic activity, the active surface area, and the stability for the oxygen reduction reaction after the combination with carbon bases. To be clear, the combination of N,S-rGO and ZnAl-LDH with several concentrations has been investigated for the first time on the ORR applications. The sensitivity analysis is implemented to determine the optimal concentration. This study proposes a new approach for using N, S-rGO composite to improve the low electron conductivity of LDHs.

AB  - Bioinspired Ni/NiO nanocomposite was synthesized in the Calotropis procera wood and its size and structure were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). The green and environmental friendly approach was performed for the preparation of copper nanocomplex (CC) under ultrasonic irradiation. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nano-biofibers containing Ni/NiO nanocomposite and copper nanocomplex were obtained by electrospinning method. This novel bio nanocomposite was character-ized by field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), TEM, and atomic force mi-croscopy (AFM) for further investigation. Novel Pt/PVA@Ni/NiO/Cu nanocomplex/chitosan (Pt/PVA@NOCC/CH) was synthesized and its catalytic performance was studied towards methanol electro-oxidation. Pt/PVA@NOCC/CH catalyst exhibits enhanced electrocatalytic performance towards methanol oxidation (MO), compared to Pt/PVA/CH and Pt/PVA@-NOCC with respect to its better stability, larger electrochemically active surface area, enhanced mass activity, and improved resistance to poisoning.

TI  - Preparation of rGO/FeMoO4 as high-performance photocatalyst for degradation of malachite green, phenol and H2 evolution under natural sunlight
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - FeMoO4 and rGO/FeMoO4 nanocomposites were successfully prepared by a facile hydro-thermal method. The XRD results confirmed that the FeMoO4 has a monometallic b-FeMoO4 crystalline phase while the rGO/FeMoO4 showed both monometallic a-and b-FeMoO4 phases where b-FeMoO4 is the predominant phase. The reduction of graphene oxide (GO) to reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was performed without using any chemical reductions. UV-Vis results showed that the visible light absorption and band gap energy were enhanced after the addition of rGO. The prepared samples were successfully applied for degradation of malachite green (MG) and phenol (Ph) and for H2 evolution under natural solar light irradiation. All the nanocomposites showed higher photocatalytic activities compared with pure FeMoO4 photocatalyst, and the 10%rGO/FeMoO4 gave the highest photodegradation performance for MG and Ph and for H2 evolution. The photodegradation results revealed that the rGO content played the crucial factor in the photodegradation of MG and Ph, and H2 evolution. The mineralization (TOC), photodegradation mechanism and degradation kinetics of MG and Ph were discussed.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Embedding Co2P nanoparticles into co-doped carbon hollow polyhedron as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for efficient overall water splitting
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The reasonable design and construction of non-precious metal electrocatalysts with low cost and high performance is critical for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, a facile polymerization-pyrolysis method is proposed to encapsulate Co2P nanoparticles in co-doped hollow carbon shell by using ZIF-67 and Pcontaining polymers as precursor. The unique construction not only effectively prevents nanoparticles from detaching, showing good stability after long-term testing, but also provides abundant active sites, large surface areas and large pore volumes, enabling the electrolyte and electrode material to full contact. As expected, the Co2P/NPSC-800 performs superior HER performance with low overpotential of 173 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and excellent stability of 88% retention for 35 h and OER performance with low overpotential of 320 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which endows Co2P/NPSC-800 with good catalytic activity in overall water-splitting. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the metallic property and the decreased reaction barriers of Co2P can promote the catalytic reactions. This work offers an effective route in synthesizing other transition metal phosphides with high catalytic properties. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Effect of uniformity and surface morphology of Pt nanoparticles to enhance oxygen reduction reaction in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Platinum (Pt)-based electrocatalysts supported by reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is fabricated under microwave-assisted polyol method with various nucleation and growth conditions. The surface morphologies of the Pt nanoparticles (NPs) under various reaction conditions owing to different Pt NP sizes and inter-particle spacings are investigated by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, cyclic and linear sweep voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The synthesized Pt/rGO catalyst under nucleation and growth times of 10 s and 50 s, respectively, exhibits excellent catalytic activity with increased electrochemical surface area, high density, good uniformity and surface morphology with a particle size and inter-particle spacing of 2.16 nm and 17.2 nm, respectively. These results elucidate the relationship between the Pt NP morphology distribution and oxygen reduction reaction of catalysts in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell systems. We also highlight the important role of size and inter-particle spacing on the Pt electrochemical catalystic performance. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Electrodeposition of cedar leaf-like graphene Oxide@Ni-Cu@Ni foam electrode as a highly efficient and ultra-stable catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction
T2  - ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
M3  - Article
AB  - Cedar leaf-like graphene Oxide@Nickel-Copper@Nickel foam (GO@Ni-Cu@NF) electrode is synthesized through an electrochemical approach and its electrocatalytic activity towards hydrogen production in a 1.0 M KOH medium is thoroughly investigated. Morphology, phase structure, and chemical state of fabricated electrodes are carefully studied. Moreover, the electrochemical characterization methods are employed to evaluate the catalytic activity and stability for electrochemical hydrogen production. The electrocatalytic properties of the GO@Ni-Cu@NF sample are promoted for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), where eta(10), eta(20) and eta(100) were measured at 70, 109, and 214 mV vs. reverse hydrogen electrode, respectively. This significant electroactivity in HER can be ascribed to the modification of GO nanosheets on the cedar leaf-like Ni-Cu@NF electrode. In addition, the GO nanosheets increase the electrochemical surface area of Ni-Cu@NF from 1790 cm(2) to 2585 cm(2) for the GO@Ni-Cu@NF electrodes. Furthermore, the Tafel slope of the GO@Ni-Cu@NF electrode (57 mV dec(-1)) confirms the predominance of Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. Overall, this study proposes a three-dimensional Ni-Cu electrode modified by GO nanoplatelets with a proper electroactivity, excellent surface area, and acceptable stability for HER.

TI  - Experimental and theoretical studies of hydrogen generation by binary metal (oxide)-graphene oxide composite materials
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Theoretical and experimental studies with focuse on hydrogen generation through the hydrolysis of graphene oxide (GO) functionalized with magnesium (GOMg), titanium (GOTi), and niobium (GONb) were performed. Thermogravimetric (TGA) results reveal variable thermal decomposition profiles for the composites, in agreement with the decomposition of the labile oxygenated groups of GO. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results show variable oxygen content (%) for the composites and the formation of MgO, TiO2, and NbO2 layers on the GO surface. The hydrogen generation studies suggest that the formation of a Mg(OH)(2) layer on the GO surface is a critical limiting factor for the hydrolysis of GOMg, whereas TiO2 and NbO2 catalyze the hydrolysis of GONb and GOTi. The hydrogen generation results reveal that GONb produced the highest H-2 yield of 2 L in 2 h compared to 1.5 L for GOTi and 1.3 L for GOMg. The results support the claim that the hydrolysis of GO functionalized with niobium and titanium are promising candidates for on-board H-2 generation applications.

TI  - Amine-functionalized carbon nanotubes supported NiAuPd nanoparticles as an efficient in-situ prepared catalyst for formic acid dehydrogenation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrogen (H-2) generation from formic acid (FA) decomposition is a promising route in practical application of hydrogen energy. As a promising H-2 supplier, besides the advantage of high H-2 content and excellent stability, FA can also be used as a mild reducing agent. Herein, an in-situ prepared NiAuPd nanoparticles (NPs) supported on aminefunctionalized carbon nanotubes (NiAuPd/NH2-CNTs) with FA as the reducing agent is successfully developed at room temperature. The as-prepared NiAuPd/NH2-CNTs are directly used for the catalytic decomposition of FA, exhibiting excellent activity and 100% H-2 selectivity with the initial turnover frequency (TOFinitial) value of 699.1 and 3006.1 mol H-2 mol Pd-1 h(-1) at 303 and 333 K, respectively. Moreover, the additive sodium formate (SF) can further facilitate the reduction process and enhance the catalytic performance, with the TOFinitial value of 4391.1 mol H-2 mol Pd-1 h(-1) at 333 K, which are comparable to most of the reported heterogeneous catalysts with the complicated post-treatment. The excellent catalytic performance of NiAuPd/NH2-CNTs is mainly attributed to the high dispersion of NPs and the boost effect of-NH2 group on O-H cleavage. This work provides a feasible strategy to design in-situ prepared catalysts for the efficient high-quality H-2 generation from FA for fuel cells application.

TI  - Palladium nanoparticles embedded in microporous carbon as electrocatalysts for water splitting in alkaline media
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The creation of carbon matrices with a high surface area for effective catalytic activity is an urgent task today, especially in the field of electrocatalysis. In this study, microporous carbon (MPS) with a surface area of about 1300 m(2) g(-1) was produced from raw plant waste (apricot pit shells) by successive thermal carbonation and chemical treatment. The MPS was impregnated with H2PdCl6 and calcined at various temperatures under a H-2-Ar flux. The obtained Pd-NP@MPC (nanoparticle size from 1 to 25 nm) catalysts were characterized in detail by XRD, SEM, TEM and BET methods. Electrochemical tests show that the prepared composites exhibit high electrocatalytic activity and remarkable stability over time (over 50 h) for the HER process and overall water splitting performance. The electrodes have very low overpotentials (h) of 95-117 mV for HER in 1 M KOH at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the Pd-NP@MPC-300 electrode can reach a high current density of 300 mA cm(-2) at h merely of 170 mV and shows excellent electrocatalytic stability in prolonged water electrolysis. The relationships between MPC matrix characteristics, Pd NPs size and electrocatalytic properties are discussed in this paper. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Facile synthesis of graphene/N-doped carbon nanowire composites as an effective electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel metal-free electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORB.) is one of the most important issues in fuel cells. Here, we report a facile method to synthesize reduced graphene oxide (rGO) decorated with nitrogen-doped carbon nanowires (rGO-CN) as an electrocatalyst for ORR. After the polymerization of polpyrrole nanowires on the rGO surface (rGO-PPy), the carbonization of rGO-PPy at 800 degrees C affords a unique nanostructured product by the integration of rGO sheets and the N-doped carbon nanowires with high nitrogen content. The morphology of rGO-CN is confirmed by TEM analysis and the chemical composition and interaction of the prepared samples are analyzed by XPS and FT-IR analysis. The electrocatalytic activity of rGO-CN toward ORR is also evaluated by the cyclic voltammetry. It is found that the rGO-CN electrode shows superior electrocatalytic performance toward ORR, compared to rGO and rGO-PPy, which demonstrates the promising potential of rGO-CN as a carbon-based, metal-free electrocatalyst for enhancing the electrocatalytic property towards ORR.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Review
AB  - In the scope of the rapid technological advancements, nanoparticles (NPs) have gained prominence due to their excellent and tunable biological, and physicochemical properties. Nowadays, different methods are used for their synthesis. In particular, the green synthesis of metal precursors for the synthesis of NPs, represents a cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and hazardous chemical-free method for developing a large variety of NPs. By exploiting plant extracts, the production rate of NPs is relatively faster. Due to fossil reserves and high fuel consumption, renewable and clean energy materials are urgently needed to improve environmental sustainability. With outstanding electrochemical and physicochemical characteristics, molybdenum-based NPs (Mo-NPs) are gaining increasing attention in the fields of energy conversion and storage. Considering the significance of Mo-NPs synthesized from greener routes and their energy applications, it is necessary to review recent trends and developments in this field. This review summarizes important research studies and future research guidelines for the preparation of Mo-NPs through green routes and their applications to meet global energy and environmental demands.

TI  - Pd-Co nanoparticles decorated on different carbon based substrates as electrocatalyst for O-2 reduction reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a facile process for the synthesis of bimetallic Pd-Co nanotubes on multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and chemically reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is reported. The synthesized nanocatalysts are characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Catalysts are evaluated for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in basic media. The electrocatalytic performance of Pd-Co supported on rGO and MWCNTs toward ORR is compared with bimetallic and single Pd nanoparticles decorated on Vulcan carbon (XC-72R) by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and rotating disk electrode (RDE) in 0.1 M NaOH solution. The specific electrochemical surface areas of Pd-Co supported on rGO is higher than the corresponding carbon supported Pd nanoparticles (222.09 vs. 41.57 m(2) g(-1), respectively). The RDE results confirm that the final product of the oxygen reduction is water and the proposed main path is direct 4 electron transfer process with smooth transfer kinetic rate on the Pd-Co/rGO in comparison to Pd-Co/C. Furthermore, the lower charge transfer resistance of the particles in ORR process for the Pd-Co/rGO compared to single Pd/C catalyst, indicating it could be excellent candidate for ORR in alkaline media.

CP  - International Conference on Sustainable Environment and Energy (ICSEE)
CL  - Hindustan Univ, Chennai, INDIA
AB  - A novel photocatalyst comprises of ZrO2-TiO2 immobilized on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) a ternary heterojunction (ZrO2 TiO2/rGO) was synthesized by using facile chemical method. The nanocomposite was prepared with a strategy to achieve better utilization of excitons for catalytic reactions by channelizing from metal oxide surfaces to rGO support. TEM and XRD analysis results revealed the heterojunction formed between ZrO2 and single crystalline anatase TiO2. The mesoporous structure of ZrO2-TiO2 was confirmed using BET analysis. The red shift in absorption edge position of ZrO2-TiO2/rGO photocatalyst was characterized by using diffuse reflectance UV-Visible spectra. ZrO2-TiO2/rGO showed greater interfacial charge transfer efficiency than ZrO2-TiO2, which was evidenced by well suppressed PL intensity and high photocurrent of ZrO2-TiO2/rGO. The suitable band gap of 1.0 wt% ZrO2-TiO2/rGO facilitated the utilization of solar light in a wide range by responding to the light of energy equal to as well as greater than 2.95 eV by the additional formation of excited high-energy electrons (HEEs). ZrO2-TiO2/rGO showed the enhanced H-2 production than TiO2/rGO, which revealed the role of ZrO2 for the effective charge separation at the heterojunction and the solar light response. The optimum loading of 1.0 wt% of ZrO2 and rGO on TiO2 showed the highest photocatalytic performance (7773 mu molh(-1)g(cat)(-1)) for hydrogen (H-2) production under direct solar light irradiation.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Herein, we fabricated bifunctional, noble metal-free, highly efficient nickel/nickel oxide on reduced graphene oxide (Ni/NiO@rGO) by chemical synthesis approach for electrochemical water splitting reaction. Its structural and morphological characterization using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), energy dispersive analysis of X-ray (EDAX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) represents, Ni/NiO@rGO is having Ni/NiO NPs similar to 10 nm (+/- 2 nm) on graphene oxide with face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure. Moreover, the presence of Ni/NiO (2.26%), O (6.56%), N (0.74%) and C (90.44%) from EDAX analysis further confirms the formation of Ni/NiO@rGO and it also supported by FTIR studies. This nanocatalyst is examined further for electrocatalytic water splitting reactions (HER and OER). It demonstrated low overpotential 582 mV to achieve current density at 10 mA cm(-2) and smaller Tafel slope of 63 mV dec(-1) obtained in 0.5 M H2SO4 towards HER. Also, at the other end at onset potential of 1.6 V vs. RHE towards OER. It demonstrated low overpotential 480 mV to achieve current density at 10 mA cm(-2) and smaller Tafel slope of 41 mV dec(-1) in 0.5 M KOH towards OER observed. Hydrogen fuel is eco-friendly to the environment and noteworthy performance of earth-saving reactions. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - One-pot synthesis of Pt/SnO2/GhTs and its electro-photo-synergistic catalysis for methanol oxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, a simple one-pot strategy was used to synthesize an anodic electrocatalyst Pt/SnO2/GNs (EDTA) for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). Under hydrothermal conditions, the reduction of H2PtCl6 and graphene oxide (GO), the oxidation of SnCl2 and the formation of SnO2 were occurred synchronously without additional reducing or oxidizing agent. The introduction of EDTA results in good dispersion and full integration of Pt and SnO2 nanoparticles, due to the complexation between Pt4+ (Sn2+) and EDTA. Electrochemical experiments show Pt/SnO2/GNs (EDTA) has much higher catalytic activity and better stability for MOR compared with the commercial Pt/C catalyst and Pt/GNs (EDTA). Furthermore, it is interesting to find that catalytic properties of Pt/SnO2/GNs (EDTA) toward MOR are significantly enhanced under external light irradiation. Especially, after UV irradiation for 30 min, Pt/SnO2/GNs (EDTA) composite shows an ultrahigh forward peak current density of 1103 mA mg(-1). The remarkably improved performances under external light irradiation mainly derives from the synergistic effects between the electro-catalytic and photo-catalytic properties, which provides a novel strategy to effectively enhance the catalytic activities of Pt catalyst in DMFCs by coupling with photoresponsive metal oxides.

TI  - Cu-MoS2/rGO hybrid material for enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction performance
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cu doped MoS2 (Cu-MoS2)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) (Cu-MoS2/rGO) hybrid material is fabricated by a facile one-step solvothermal method. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results suggest that the doping of Cu does not alter the crystal structure of MoS2. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis reveal that the doping of Cu atoms influences the electronic structure of MoS2, which is favorable to increase active sites of edges. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results indicate that Cu-MoS2/rGO performed a faster charge-transfer in comparison to MoS2/rGO hybrid. In addition, the resultant Cu -MoS2/rGO catalyst with Cu/Mo mole ratio of 9% exhibits a lower overpotential of 199 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), small Tafel slop of 44 mV dec(-1) and cycling stability, indicative of enhanced electrocatalytic activity towards HER. The improved performance is attributed to the increased active sites and a synergistic effect between copper and molybdenum, leading to electronic structure change and charge redistribution of MoS2.

TI  - Rational design of PdCu nanoparticles supported on a templated Ni foam: The cooperation effect of morphology and composition for electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, with the goal of the production of a cost effective anode for ethanol oxidation, the surface of Ni foam is covered with templated PdCu nanoparticles via the galvanic replacement reaction. The use of the templating method results in the uniform formation of the spongiform bimetallic structure on the surface of Ni foam. The role of the templating method in the synthesis of a stable catalyst towards dealloying process is considered by the electrochemical pretreatment of t-PdCu/NF and PdCu/NF in H2SO4 solution. The excellent stability of t-PdCu/NF for ethanol oxidation in the alkaline media is proved by the achievement in the steady state after 14 s with survival of 60% current density and 12% increase in the current density after 100 consecutive cycles. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy gives evidence that the templating method and elemental composition cooperate in the improvement of the reactant diffusion and charge transfer on the surface of the synthesized catalyst. Finally, the mechanism of the ethanol oxidation and the effect of morphology and composition on this mechanism are studied using the cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry methods.

TI  - TiO2 nanotubes supported ultrafine MnCo2O4 nanoparticles as a superior-performance anode for lithium-ion capacitors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) are considered as a promising energy storage device possessing large specific energy along with high specific power due to the integration of the merits of electric double-layer capacitors (ELDCs) and lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). In the present work, TiO2 nanotubes supported ultrafine MnCo2O4 nanoparticles with the size of 5-10 nm is solvothermally synthesized. It is found that the introduction of TiO2 nanotubes can weaken the aggregation of MnCo2O4 nanoparticles, therefore causing the enhancement in the electrode/electrolyte interfacial contact and the reduction in Li thorn diffusion path. Benefiting from the synergy effect of MnCo2O4 and TiO2 which can alleviate the volume change of MnCo2O4, the MnCo2O4/TiO2 composite used in LIBs displays a large reversible capacity of 743 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1) after 100 cycles and impressive rate performance. This composite as anode is assembled with an activated carbon (AC) electrode as cathode into MnCo2O4/TiO2//AC LIC working in a wide voltage range of 0.5-4 V. This LIC can deliver high specific energies of 89.8 and 44.1 Wh kg(-1) at specific power of 0.25 and 3.41 kW kg(-1), respectively, and presents outstanding cyclic stability (76.4% of initial capacity at the end of 5000 cycles).

TI  - Effect of cation substitution in MnCo2O4 spinel anchored over rGO for enhancing the electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing an efficient and durable electrocatalyst for catalyzing oxygen evolution reaction in electrochemical water splitting application is greatly desired and challenging. Herein, a simple and facile strategy was followed to prepare Ni-substituted MnCo2O4/rGO nanocomposite as an electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The structural and morphological analyses show the successful bonding between spinel-carbon hybrid. Nickel substitution and addition of rGO disclose a drastic change in the catalytic activity of the same towards OER. Among all the electrocatalysts, Mn1-xNixCo2O4/rGO with x = 0.6 exhibits low overpotential of 250 and 290 mV for attaining the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) before and after potential cycling respectively. It also exhibits low onset potential of 1.48 V with a Tafel slope of value 78 mV/dec. The electrocatalyst also shows excellent stability, high ECSA and roughness factor (R-f) which are responsible for enhanced OER performance. These properties confirm that the present hybrid material would be an excellent electrocatalyst for catalyzing OER for hydrogen energy production. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article

CP  - 11th International Symposium on Advances in Electrochemical Science and Technology (ISAEST)
CL  - Chennai, INDIA
AB  - The development of efficient and durable earth-abundant electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is an ongoing challenge. In this work, we directly anchored CoS nanocatalysts (20 wt%) on different supports, namely, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and reduced graphene oxide by a single-pot hydrothermal route. The developed synthesis processes enabled us to alter the composite nature of CoS by changing the sulfur precursor used. The corresponding electrocatalytic performance of these composite catalysts toward the ORR was studied in alkaline medium. The increase in the effective electrode surface area that accompanies the CoS nanocomposite substantially boosts its ORR catalytic performance. The CoS-CNT-Cy hybrid material shows an onset potential of 0.85 V, which is 60-200 mV less negative than that of other catalysts tested. The catalytic current density achieved with the hybrid material at 0.2 mg cm(-2) is comparable with that of commercial Pt/C (20%). The synergistic effect of CNTs and CoS enhances the overall performance of the hybrid catalyst. Extension of this nanocomposite strategy to other earth-abundant materials could similarly enable inexpensive electrocatalysts that lack the high intrinsic activity of the noble metals.

TI  - Designing of some platinum or palladium-based nanoalloys as effective electrocatalysts for methanol oxidation reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nano alloys contain noble metal nanostructures exhibit a wide theoretical and experimental interest in the field of fuel cells. Hard endeavors have been enhanced to improve the catalytic performance and minimize the usage of precious metals by alloying them with non-precious ones. Formation of bimetallic and trimetallic noble metal alloys with well-designed structures provide the opportunity to reach this goal. In this study, we first discuss the synthesis of noble metal alloy nanostructured thin films such as PtCu, PdCu, PtCu/reduced-graphene oxide (RGO), PdCu/RGO, PtCo, PtCo/RGO, PtPdCu and PtPdCu/RGO via a simple reduction of organometallic precursors including [PtCl2 (cod)] and [PdCl2(cod)], (cod = cis, cis-1,5-cyclooctadiene), in the presence of [Cu(acac)(2)] and [Co(acac)(3)] (acac = acetylacetonate) at oil/water interface and room temperature, including nano particles and nanosheets. Then the effects of the well-defined nanostructures on the improved electrochemical properties are outlined. Finally, we conclude that these non precious bi and trimetallic alloy nanostructured thin films have better electrocatalytic performance than Pt monometallic thin films and other Pt nanostructures due to the geometric, electronic and stabilizer effect.

AB  - The oxygen containing functional groups of graphene oxide (GO) play an important role in hydrogen storage. In addition to the contribution of the specific surface area and micro porous porosity, the interactions of the functional groups with H-2\ molecules are also an important factor in the aspect of GO hydrogen storage. This paper explores the oxygen containing functional groups affecting the hydrogen physisorption capacity of the GO and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) by experimental H-2 adsorption measurement and theoretical calculation. Experimental results related to synthesis of GO and RGO via the modified Hummer's method and characterized using SEM, TEM, SAED, XRD, FTIR, TGA and Raman spectroscopy, are presented. Compared with RGO, the surface and edge of GO contain a large amount of oxygen-containing functional groups and its specific surface area is slightly increased through BET measurement. GO is found to exhibit better H-2 uptake capacity (0.74 wt%) as compared to RGO (0.47 wt%) at 77 K and pressure up to 10 bars. The density functional theory is applied to optimize the adsorption configurations of H-2 on the surface of samples. Calculation results show that the adsorption on the GO can be promoted by surface functional groups epoxy, hydroxyl, carboxyl and carbonyl; the enhancement of hydroxyl is greater than other species on the surface and the maximal adsorption energy reaches to -0.112 eV which is about twice that of graphene. As indicated above, these functional groups could be formed easily on the graphene surface, which not only enhance specific surface area and interlayer spacing, but also significantly change the location of carbons, redistributing the electron structure of graphene and enhancing the adsorption energy.

TI  - Enhanced electrochemical performance of nickel intercalated ZIF-67/rGO composite electrode for solid-state supercapacitors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ni (Nickel) doped zeolitic-imidazolate framework (ZIF-67) has been prepared in presence of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to realize a ZIF-67/rGO composite. The doping level of Ni and the ratio of rGO (wt%) in the composite have been optimized to attain desirable redox activity and electrical conductivity. A partial incorporation of redox active Ni ions to substitute Co (cobalt) ions in ZIF-67 has resulted in better electrochemical characteristics by inducing additional pseudocapacitance. A finalized composite with 33% Ni and 20% of rGO (i.e, Ni-33/ZIF-67/rGO(20)) has been used as a supercapacitor electrode material to achieve a high specific capacitance of 304 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g in the presence of 1 M H2SO4 as an aqueous electrolyte. The above electrode has also been tested for an all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor in the presence of a polymer gel electrolyte (PVA/1 M H2SO4). This device delivered high values of power and energy densities, i.e., 1 kW/kg and 21.5 Wh/kg, respectively. The device also exhibited an excellent cyclic stability. About 87% of capacitance could be retained even after 4500 charge-discharge cycles. The device has shown superior results for a working potential window of 0-2 V. The practical usefulness of the device has been demonstrated by preparing a symmetrical supercapacitor, which could energize a white LED for 8 min upon a charging of only 40 s.

TI  - Photocatalytic water splitting ability of Fe/MgO-rGO nanocomposites towards hydrogen evolution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Photocatalytic water splitting has greatly stimulated as an ideal technique for producing hydrogen (H-2) fuel by employing two renewable sources, i.e., water and solar energy. Here, we have adopted a facile hydrothermal approach for the successful synthesis of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) incorporated Fe/MgO nanocomposites followed by thermal treatment at inert atmosphere to investigate their ability for photodegradation and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution via water splitting. Transmission Electron Microscopy images of Fe/MgO-rGO nanocomposite ensured the distribution of Fe/MgO nanoparticles throughout rGO sheets. Notably, all rGO supported nanocomposites, especially the one, thermally treated at 500 degrees C at Argon (Ar) atmosphere has demonstrated significantly higher photocatalytic efficiency towards the photodegradation of a toxic textile dye, rhodamine B, than pristine MgO and commercially available Degussa P25 titania nanoparticles as well as other composites. Under solar irradiation, Fe/MgO-rGO (500) nanocomposite exhibited 86% degradation of rhodamine B dye and generated almost four times higher H-2 via photocatalytic water splitting compared to commercially available P25 titania nanoparticles. This promising photocatalytic ability of the Fe/MgO-rGO(500) nanocomposite can be attributed to the improved morphological and surface features due to heat treatment at inert atmosphere as well as escalated charge carrier separation with increased light absorption capacity imputed to rGO incorporation.

TI  - Mechanochemically assisted fabrication of ultrafine Pd nanoparticles on natural waste-derived nitrogen-doped porous carbon for the efficient formic acid decomposition
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Utilizing natural waste as carbon source to prepare porous carbon with ultrahigh surface area and developing a facile protocol to synthesize supported metal nanoparticles toward an efficient formic acid (FA) decomposition are vital but remains challenging. Here, discarded ginkgo leaves were utilized as carbon source to prepare ginkgo leaf-derived porous carbon (GLPC) with an ultrahigh surface area of 3851 m(2)/g. Based on the as-prepared nitrogen-doped GLPC (N-GLPC) after "soft " nitriding, a facile solid-state reduction strategy with mortar-pestle grinding and without the use of any organic solvent and stabilizing ligand was developed to synthesize ultrafine and well-distributed Pd nanoparticles (NPs) with a diameter of 2.7 +/- 0.7 nm. The "soft " nitriding temperature and addition of base during preparation played vital roles in the activity of the fabricated catalysts. The Pd/N-GLPC-350 exhibited the highest catalytic activity toward decomposing FA, achieving a high turnover frequency of 2952 h(-1) at 333 K. The Pd/N-GLPC-350 was quite stable and could be reused at least five times without evident activity loss. This study provides a facile solid-state reduction protocol with mortar-pestle grinding to synthesize metal NPs by using natural waste-derived porous carbon as support toward efficient FA decomposition.

TI  - Synergistic enhancement of pi-electron density in graphitic carbon nitride for significantly improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under visible-light irradiation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, a synergistic strategy integrated elemental doping and defect engineering has been developed to modulate the electronic and bandgap structure of g-C3N4 by controlling its conjugated aromatic system. Experimental analysis and theoretical calculations confirm that the generation of imbalanced spatial distributions of charge carriers not only greatly increases the pi-electron availability, but also decreases the energy barrier for hydrogen adsorption due to the synergistic effect of the high valence electron of the W dopant and the decreased electronegativity by two-coordinated nitrogen defects, which strengthens the charge transfer efficiency and favors the light capturing capability. The combined benefits of the electronic, optical and textural modification lead to a significant improvement of photocatalytic activity of 3.3 mmol h(-1) g(-1) for hydrogen evolution under l > 400 nm light irradiation, about twentyfold enhancement than that of pristine g-C3N4. Such proposed synergistic strategy provides a promising route to promote the performance of g-C3N4 for potential applications in solar energy conversion. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Synergetic catalysis of Ni-Pd nanoparticles supported on biomass-derived carbon spheres for hydrogen production from ammonia borane at room temperature
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, carbon spheres with well-controlled nano-morphologies is fabricated by hydrothermal carbonization of biomass in the presence of sodium polyacrylate. Bimetallic Ni-x-Pd-y nanoparticles are successfully anchored on the carbon spheres and used as the heterogeneous catalyst for the hydrogen generation from ammonia borane. This combination of bimetallic Ni-Pd with carbon spheres is first proven to be responsible for the efficient production of hydrogen from ammonia borane, providing the turnover frequency value of 182 mol H-2 mol catalyst(-1) min(-1) at room temperature. The superior catalytic activity of the catalyst can be ascribed to the highly dispersed Ni-Pd nanoparticles and the synergetic interaction of the metal and the support. The present heterogeneous catalytic system presents itself as an excellent contender for clean hydrogen production via room temperature dehydrogenation of ammonia borane.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Here, novel polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanofibers with incorporated CuO and Co3O4 nanoparticles (PVA-CuO-Co3O4) were synthesized through a conventional single-nozzle electrospinning technique and characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), elemental analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), differential thermal analysis (DTA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Novel Pt/polyvinyl alcohol-CuO-Co3O4/chitosan (Pt/PVA-CuO-Co3O4/CH) catalyst was successfully prepared. EDX, TEM, and FT-IR spectroscopy techniques were used to characterize the prepared catalysts. The electrocatalytic activity of Pt/PVA-CuO-Co3O4/CH catalyst was investigated for methanol electrooxidation through cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, CO stripping voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques. The effects of some experimental factors for methanol electrooxidation were studied on the prepared catalysts and the optimum conditions were determined. Pt/PVA-CuO-Co3O4/CH catalyst had extraordinary electrocatalytic activity for methanol electrooxidation. It exhibited better stability, higher electrochemically active surface area, and better antipoisoning effect than Pt/PVA-CuO-Co3O4 and Pt/PVA/CH catalysts indicating that Pt/PVA-CuO-Co3O4/CH could be a promising catalyst for direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) applications. A real DMFC was designed, assembled and tested with Pt/PVA-CuO-Co3O4/CH as anodic catalyst. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

M3  - Review
AB  - The significance of H2O2 in biological systems and its wide application in various areas, such as municipal wastewater treatment, aseptic packaging, etc., have enabled the development of simple, stable, and highly sensitive H2O2 sensors that have gained growing research interest. With the fast development of nanotechnology, the emergence of enzyme-free electrochemical H2O2 sensors based on efficient enzyme-mimetic electrocatalysts has opened up new horizons for researchers. Among them, carbon nanomaterials stand out from many nanomaterials with enzyme-like electrocatalytic activity due to their remarkable structural diversity, considerable cost-effectiveness, as well as fascinating and stable physicochemical properties. Importantly, carbon nanomaterials can act as nano-supports for other electrocatalysts in addition to being directly used as electrocatalysts. Moreover, the carbon hybrid nanocomposites tend to be superior to each component in electrochemical performance due to synergistic effects. Therefore, carbon hybrid nanocomposites are emerging as promising materials for highly efficient and sensitive enzyme-free electrochemical H2O2 detection. In this review, we overview the recent advances of carbon hybrid nanocomposites in enzyme-free electrochemical H2O2 sensing, covering the characteristics and performance of various carbon hybrid nanocomposites based on other electrocatalysts hybridized with carbon nanomaterials and the optimized design of carbon hybrid nanocomposites in improving the enzyme-free electrochemical detection of H2O2.

TI  - Hydrogen production from organic fatty acids using carbon-doped TiO2 nanoparticles under visible light irradiation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The photocatalytic production of H-2 using carbon-doped TiO2 (C-TiO2) nanoparticles has been investigated in single or mixed systems of organic fatty acids (OFAs) under visible light irradiation, including acetic acid, propionate acid, butyric acid and lactic acid. When OFAs were applied at the same electron density (10 e-eq L-1), the H-2 evolution rates followed the order of propionic acid > butyric acid approximate to acetic acid > lactic acid, whereas at the same molar concentration (0.5 mol L-1), that order changed to lactic acid > acetic acid > butyric acid approximate to propionic acid. This result implied that the electron transfer efficiency differed from four OFAs, probably due to their different affinity with C-TiO2. and CH3. partially contributed to OFAs degradation and H-2 production. The quantum dynamics simulations of electron transfer revealed that the dominant mechanism of H-2 production was direct electron transfer from adsorbed OFAs to C-TiO2. This work aims to pursue the synergy of solar energy utilization and conversion of OFAs into H-2. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Comprehensive Study on Methods and Materials for Photocatalytic Water Splitting and Hydrogen Production as a Renewable Energy Resource
T2  - JOURNAL OF INORGANIC AND ORGANOMETALLIC POLYMERS AND MATERIALS
M3  - Review
AB  - High energy consumption, rapid increase in its demand and depletion of energy resources in the world are compelling the researchers for exploration of renewable energy resources in order to attain sustain development of nations. Many existing resources are being used to fulfil the current requirements. But these existing resources are also causing serious environmental pollution which is a very serious concern of the current era. Therefore, there is an immense need to think and produce environment friendly and sustainable renewable energy resources. Water, being abundant on Earth, is one of the most suitable sources of hydrogen energy. In this work the splitting of water and hydrogen production by different techniques, specially the promising photocatalysis technique, are discussed in detail. The water splitting and hydrogen production depend upon the properties of photocatalysts which rose from the nature, composition and other factors of photocatalysts. Therefore, this study discussed different materials like metal oxides, metal sulphides, nanocomposites, etc. which are used for photocatalytic hydrogen production. In addition, the pros and cons of the utilized materials are discussed to select the best class of materials for hydrogen production from water splitting. This review will help the beginners of this field to understand the basic mechanisms of different hydrogen production techniques along with their advantages and disadvantages. However, it will also help the field experts and industrialists to select the best class of materials for hydrogen evolution from water splitting.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 2nd International Conference on Sustainable Environment and Energy (ICSEE)
CL  - Chennai, INDIA
AB  - A ternary reduced graphene oxide loaded InVO4-g-C3N4 nanocomposite was prepared by the wet impregnation method. The formation of InVO4-g-C3N4 heterojunction and loading of rGO was corroborated by XRD, FTIR, UV-vis, TEM and XPS studies. Incorporation of both InVO4 and rGO in g-C3N4 substantially increased the absorption edge of the photocatalyst from 451 nm (2.75eV) of g-C3N4 to 546 nm (2.27 eV) due to the formation of heterojunction. Interestingly, among the different weight % of both InVO4 and rGO loaded g-C3N4, 3.0 wt% of rGO and 30 wt% of InVO4 loaded g-C3N4 has shown a superior hydrogen production of 7449 mu mol g(-1)h(-1), a 45 times enhancement in comparison to g-C3N4. This can be related to the synergetic boosting of charge carrier separation at InVa(4)-g-C3N4 heterojunction and transportation through rGO support as revealed by photoluminescence and photocurrent studies. Moreover, the hydrogen production rate obtained in the present binary nanocomposite was almost 8 times higher than the previously reported hydrogen production rate using the same binary InVO4-g-C3N4 nanocomposites without rGO support.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, P-type single crystal silicon (Si) was used to make porous silicon (PS) using an anodization cell. The prepared PS samples were first coated with Pd nanoparticles by electroless method (Pd/PS); then, graphene oxide (GO) sol was spin coated on them. Pd/PS coated with GO (GO-Pd/PS/Si) characterization has been carried out using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Electrochemical characterization and hydrogen storage were studied for all electrodes (Si, PS, Pd/PS and GO-Pd/PS/Si) by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), respectively. The highest hydrogen storage capacity was obtained for GO-Pd/PS/Si, which was 546.1 mAh g(-1) equal to 2.1 wt% hydrogen. The results indicate that the storage capacity of the GO-Pd/PS/Si electrode decreases only 1% of initial capacitance, after 100 cycles. Also, the EIS studies show that GOPd/PS/Si electrode performs electrochemically better than other electrodes. Considerable hydrogen storage in GO-Pd/PS/Si shows that this newly synthesized material could be a good candidate to be used in mobile hydrogen storage applications.

The electrochemical activities of Pt NPs were measured by cyclic voltammograms. The poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) was used as a modifier agent which formed a functionalized layer on graphene oxide (GO) sheets. As a result, the electrochemical active surface area (ESA) of PDDA functionalized GO supported Pt (Pt/PDDA-graphene) was shown to 66 m(2)/g that indicated higher hydrogen adsorption amount than 55 m(2)/g of the pristine Pt/graphene. In addition, an average particle size of Pt/PDDA-graphene NPs was measured to 1.8 nm slightly smaller than 2.0 nm of pristine Pt/graphene NPs. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

TI  - TiO2-graphene nanocomposites for photocatalytic hydrogen production from splitting water
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - TiO2 (P25)-graphene (P25-GR) hybrids were prepared via solvothermal reaction of graphene oxide and P25 using ethanol as solvent. The as-prepared P25-GR nanocomposites were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, photoluminescence emission spectroscopy and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The results indicated that P25-GR nanocomposites possessed enhanced light absorption ability and charge separation efficiency. As photocatalysts, P25-GR hybrids were much better than the bare P25, when they were used in the hydrogen evolution from aqueous methanol solution under Xe-lamp illumination. A significant enhancement in the rate of hydrogen production was achieved through using P25-GR as photocatalysts, comparing to bare P25. The optimum mass ratio of GR to P25 in the hybrids was 0.5 wt%. The higher mass ratio of GR in P25-GR would decrease the photocatalytic activity of P25.

TI  - Graphene modified Co-B catalysts for rapid hydrogen production from NaBH4 hydrolysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Graphene oxide (GO) modified Co-B catalysts for NaBH4 hydrolysis have been synthesized by the chemical reduction in this work. The structural features and catalytic performance of as-prepared samples have been investigated and discussed as a function of amounts of GO. According to structure characterization, the catalysts still retain the amorphous structure of Co-B alloy with the addition of GO, while GO exists as reduced GO (r-GO). The textural analysis and morphology observation indicate that the appropriate amount of GO in Co-B catalyst results in the obvious increase of specific surface area and uniform clustered morphology, which contributes to improve active surface area for catalytic reactions. The results of surface species characterization show that the electron density at active Co sites increases due to an electron transfer from B to Co facilitated by r-GO. It has been found that 50 mg GO modified Co-B catalyst exhibits especially high activity with a hydrogen generation rate of 14.34 L min(-1).g(catalyst)(-1) and much lower activation energy of 26.2 kJ mol(-1) for hydrolysis reaction of NaBH4. Meanwhile, the reusability evaluations show that the catalyst preserves high stability which can still maintain 81.5% of its initial activity after 5 catalytic cycles.

TI  - An efficient preparation method of RGO/ZnIn2S4 for photocatalytic hydrogen generation under visible light
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A series of RGO/ZnIn2S4 photocatalysts were successfully synthesized using ZnIn2S4 with different graphene oxide (GO) sources (GO-S, GO-O, GO-V) and characterized by various analysis techniques, such as UV-Vis, XRD, SEM, BET, Raman and PL. It was found that the properties of these photocatalysts greatly depended on the GO source and amount. The photocatalytic H-2 evolution activities of these catalysts have also been evaluated under visible-light irradiation. When the GO source was GO-S and the GO amount was 0.1 wt%, the activity reached 1210 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) and the apparent quantum yield (420 nm) determined to be 17.49%. On the basis of the characterization of the catalysts, the effect of the preparation method of (RGO)/ZnIn2S4 on the photocatalytic activity of RGO/ZnIn2S4 was discussed in detail.

TI  - Microwave-assisted synthesis of Ag-TiO2/graphene composite for hydrogen production under visible light irradiation
T2  - CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Novel photocatalysts based on silver (Ag), TiO2, and graphene were successfully synthesized by microwave-assisted hydrothermal method. The prepared photocatalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The influence of silver loading and graphene incorporation on photocatalytic hydrogen (H-2) production of as-prepared samples was investigated in methanolic aqueous solution under visible light irradiation (lambda >= 420 nm). The results showed that Ag-TiO2/graphene composite had appreciably enhanced photo catalytic H-2 production performance under visible light illumination compared to pure TiO2, Ag-TiO2 and TiO2/graphene samples. The enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of Ag-TiO2/graphene composite under visible light irradiation could be attributed to increased visible light absorption, reduced recombination of photogenerated charge carriers and high specific surface area. This novel study provides more insight for the development of novel visible light responsive TiO2- graphene based photocatalysts for energy applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

M3  - Article
AB  - Herein, we report nanocomposite of titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanorods decorated reduced graphene oxide (TiO2/RGO) nanocomposite prepared using the simple, one-pot hydrothermal route for electrode material in supercapacitor applications. A systematic comparison study was carried out for the TiO2 nanorods coated on graphite foil in presence of alkaline media 3 M KOH, NaCl, and Na2SO4 using the three-electrode method. The TiO2/ RGO composite shows an excellent specific capacitance (Csp) of 330 Fg-1 at the discharge current density 0.5 Ag-1 in presence of 3 M KOH electrolyte solution. The obtained highest specific capacitance values in order by various electrolytes are observed as KOH > NaCl > Na2SO4. The long-term cycle stability of charge and discharge cycle at current density 0.5 Ag-1 over 1000 cycles and only 8% decay in the specific capacitance of TiO2/ RGO nanocomposite was observed in 3 M KOH electrolyte. The improved electrochemical performance TiO2/RGOcomposite in presence of KOH electrolyte is shown to be the most suitable electrode for the supercapacitors.

AB  - The bismuth nanoparticles modified graphene oxide composites (Bi-NPs@GO) and bismuth nanoparticles (Bi-NPs) were prepared by a hydrothermal method. The activated aluminum/bismuth nanoparticles Bi-NPs@GO/Al and Bi-NPs/Al were prepared. Their hydrolysis reaction performance were studied. The experimental results show that the composite of aluminum and Bi-NPs@GO can react rapidly with water. The 4-h milled Bi-NPs@GO/Al composite shows better hydrogen generation performance and reacted with tap water even at 0 degrees C. The Bi-NPs@GO/Al composite exhibits high hydrogen generation rate at room temperature. The enhancement of aluminum hydrolysis in the composite may be due to that the addition of nano-scale Bi and graphene oxide. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Hydrogen sensing properties of Pd/SnO2 nano-spherical composites under UV enhancement
T2  - SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid and efficient detection of hydrogen plays an important role in the development of hydrogen energy. The response and selectivity of typical metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) sensors to low concentration hydrogen detection still need to be improved to meet the application of hydrogen. In this work, Pure SnO2 hollow spheres and different molar ratio of Pd decorated SnO2 spherical composites were synthesized by a facile template-free hydrothermal method. High response of 14.5 and fast response/recovery time of 2.2/22.4 s to 200 ppm hydrogen were achieved by 5.0 mol% Pd/SnO2 at 330 degrees C. The response to 200 ppm hydrogen was enhanced to 18.1 and the recovery time was also improved to 17.4 s with 10 mW/cm(2) UV irradiation. Especially, the response to inter-fering gases was inhibited with UV irradiation, which improved the selectivity of as-prepared sensors to hydrogen molecules. Linear dependence of the responses of as-prepared sensors on the hydrogen concentration was observed, indicating the great potential for quantitative detection of H-2 at ppm level. This work provides a facile route to synthesize porous spherical Pd/SnO2 for hydrogen detection and a reference for the future design of hydrogen detectors with UV irradiation.

TI  - Novel palladium-decorated molybdenum carbide/ polyaniline nanohybrid material as superior electrocatalyst for fuel cell application
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study demonstrates the facile synthesis of palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs) decorated molybdenum carbide/polyaniline (MoC/PANI) nanohybrid material using a hydrothermal method followed by a high-temperature carbonization process. As-synthesized MoC/PANI/ PdNPs nanohybrid material was characterized using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectrometry, X-ray diffractometer, and field-emission scanning electron microscopy techniques. The developed nanohybrid material was coated over a screen-printed carbon electrode (SPE) to fabricate MoC/PANI/PdNPs/SPE and applied for the efficient electrooxidation of methanol (MeOH) under alkaline medium using cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry techniques. The electrochemical behaviour of the developed electrode showed excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of MeOH with high durability. The electrooxidation capability of the prepared electrode was compared with commercial 10% Pd/C and other recently reported electrocatalysts. The MoC/PANI/PdNPs/SPE showed superior electrocatalytic property due to specific surface morphology, intense surface area, and higher-mass activity over MoC/PdNPs/SPE, and Pd/ C/SPE modified electrodes. Therefore, the fabricated MoC/PANI/PdNPs/SPE is proved to be an excellent electrocatalyst and alternative electrode material for direct MeOH fuel cell (DMFCs) applications in future energy technology.(c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Cobalt nickel boride nanocomposite as high-performance anode catalyst for direct borohydride fuel cell
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Similar to MXene, MAB is a group of 2D ceramic/metallic boride materials which exhibits unique properties for various applications. However, these 2D sheets tend to stack and therefore lose their active surface area and functions. Herein, an amorphous cobalt nickel boride (Co-Ni-B) nanocomposite is prepared with a combination of 2D sheets and nano particles in the center to avoid agglomeration. This unique structure holds the 2D nano sheets with massive surface area which contains numerous catalytic active sites. This nanocomposite is prepared as an electrocatalyst for borohydride electrooxidation reaction (BOR). It shows outstanding catalytic activity through improving the kinetic parameters of BH4- oxidation, owing to abundant ultrathin 2D structure on the surface, which provide free interspace and electroactive sites for charge/mass transport. The anode catalyst led to a 209 mW/cm(2) maximum power density with high open circuit potential of 1.06 Vat room temperature in a miniature direct borohydride fuel cell (DBFC). It also showed a great longevity of up to 45 h at an output power density of 64 mW/cm(2), which is higher than the Co-B, Ni-B and PtRu/C. The cost reduction and prospective scale-up production of the Co-Ni-B catalyst are also addressed. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - ULTRASONICS SONOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Herein, a ternary nanocomposite, comprising metal oxide (InVO4 and TiO2) photocatalysts supported on rGO sheets was prepared via the hydrothermal method in the presence and absence of ultrasound irradiation. The photocatalytic performance of the prepared rGO/InVO4-TiO2 nanocomposites was evaluated for H-2 evolution activity from water splitting with glycerol as a sacrificial agent. Interestingly, a synergistic effect (6-fold) was observed with rGO/InVO4-TiO2 nanocomposite prepared with the help of ultrasound compared to the samples prepared without ultrasound. The optimized nanocomposite (rGO/InVO4-TiO2) exhibited a maximum H-2 evolution of 1669 pmol h(-1), a similar to 13-fold enhancement compared to the bare TiO2. This remarkable enhancement is mainly due to the synergistic effect induced by ultrasonic irradiation along with the shifting of the optical band gap of TiO2 from 3.20 eV to 2.80 eV by loading of InVO4 and rGO and also strong chemical bonding between metal (Ti) and C through Ti-C bond formation, as identified by UV-vis DRS spectra and XPS spectra, respectively. Moreover, a significant quenching of PL emission intensity and smaller radius arc of the Nyquist plot in the EIS were observed when the rGO and InVO4 were loaded in TiO2, indicating the efficient charge carriers separation and transfer in the presence of rGO sheet, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activity. Thus, application of ultrasound has played significant and important roles in substantially enhancing hydrogen evolution along with rGO and InVO4 acting as support and co-catalyst, respectively.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, graphene oxide membranes showed interesting performances in terms of high permeating flux and perm-selectivity in several applications of gas separation because of their inherent properties combined to a low energy consumption. In this paper, a graphene oxide layer is coated on modified TiO2-alumina tubular substrate in order to prepare graphene oxide nanocomposite membranes useful for hydrogen separation. Nanocomposite graphene oxide membrane samples were obtained by using vacuum deep coating method, depositing the graphene oxide solution as single layers on TiO2-alumina substrate. Temperature and pressure variations were evaluated to achieve high H-2 permeance, high H-2/CO2 selectivity and membrane performance stability during the experimental tests. Furthermore, it was found that the temperature increase causes a permselectivity (H-2/N-2 and H-2/CO2) decrease, while the transmembrane pressure increase involves a general improvement of the perm-selectivity.

GO samples were studied by Scanning Electron Microscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy, Raman Spectroscopy, Xray diffraction and UV-vis spectroscopy. Then, GO was used to obtain TiO2/GO nano composite electrodes via electrochemical deposition process. Titanium dioxide nanotubes (TiO2NT) were obtained via anodization in electrolyte containing ethylene glycol with 1 wt % NH4F. Different conditions of deposition process of GO were examined. The resulting electrodes were characterized by SEM, TEM, X-ray diffraction, UV-vis spectroscopy and electrochemical methods. The results have shown that the expanded graphite is a good carbon source to synthesize highly oxidized graphene oxide.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the significance of Ascorbic Acid (AA) fuel cells in biological systems and energy storage applications, the development of efficient electrochemical strategies is needed. In the present work, the electrochemical oxidation of AA is performed with Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs) anodes which have controlled oxygen content, modulated by acid reflux treatment. Furthermore, a total oxygen content increase of just 2% on MWCNTs surface was sufficient to achieve an enhanced AA electrocatalytic oxidation. The oxygen content was notoriously lower than other nanocarbon materials like unzipped carbon nanotubes and reduced graphene oxide which normally are considered as optimal materials. The surface chemical composition on MWCNTs was analyzed by XPS. The anodes were prepared as carbon film electrodes (CFE) by dropping cast procedure on GC surface (current collector). Cyclic voltammetry was used to evaluate the electrochemical responses of these electrode materials varying the concentration of AA (10, 50 and 100 mM). At a fixed concentration, the electrochemical responses show an increase in current and a shift of peak potential that facilitate oxidation as the acid treatment time increases. It was found that the COO- groups are responsible for the enhanced catalytic behavior of these modified MWCNTs. The simple change of functional groups by the same acid treatment procedure at different times has a notorious effect on AA oxidation. These findings provide straightforward selection criteria for anodes devoted to AA fuel cell design. Also, it is demonstrated that MWCNTs can still provide new alternatives for enhanced electrocatalytic processes. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

GO-TiO2 nanocomposites were synthesized by visible-light assisted anchoring, while the study of morphology, crystalline structure, size, surface area and optical characterization of the material was carried out by SEM, XRD, TEM, BET and UV-Vis spectroscopy, respectively. Photocatalytic activity evaluation of the composite material (GO-TiO2) towards hydrogen production through the water splitting reaction from water under visible light was followed by gas chromatography, reaching a production of 6500 mu molH(2)/g, thus showing an enhancement effect compared to the conventional H-2 production using TiO2 only.

TI  - Exfoliated MoS2 with porous graphene nanosheets for enhanced electrochemical hydrogen evolution

AB  - Porous graphene (P-rGO) was synthesized from graphene oxide (GO) via a one-pot calcination method with CO2 as an activation agent at 800 degrees C. Due to the special porous structure, the surface area of P-rGO can be increased to similar to 759 m(2)/g. The P-rGO was then used as a support to incorporate with chemical exfoliated molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) for the fabrication of MoS2/P-rGO composite. Compared to bulk MoS2, the exfoliated MoS2 is in the 1T phase with a metallic property and smaller charge transfer resistance, thus has a better activity in electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The HER activity of 1T MoS2 could be further increased after the combination with P-rGO. The overpotential of 1T MoS2/P-rGO was only similar to 130 mV vs. RHE, and the corresponding Tafel slope was similar to 75 mV Dec(-1). The special porous structure and good electric conductivity of P-rGO decrease the charge transfer resistance of the composite without sheltering too many active sites of MoS2, thus leading to the enhanced HER activity. As an efficient noble metal free HER catalyst, the 1T MoS2/P-rGO has great potential for large-scale hydrogen production. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Facile controlled synthesis of coral-like nanostructured Sb2O3@Sb anode materials for high performance sodium-ion batteries
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sb2O3@Sb composites consisting of a coral-like nano-Sb skeleton with surface decorated Sb2O3 nanoparticles were synthesized and evaluated as sodium-ion battery anodes. The facile synthesis route involves etching of elemental Al from a SbsAl95 alloy to obtain the coral-like nano-Sb, which was then subjected to mild oxidization in air to introduce Sb2O3. The optimal elemental and phase composition was achieved by tuning and controlling the preparation parameters. The Sb2O3 on the surface synergistically reduces anode volume changes to stabilize the composite structure whilst significantly accelerates the electro-chemical kinetics. The three-dimensional network in Sb2O3@Sb composite also possesses a Sb2O3@Sb uniform porous structure that effectively relieves the volume changes and provides fast Na+ transportation channels. The best Sb2O3@Sb composite from this study shows the significantly improved specific capacity of 724.3 mAh g(-1) at 1000 mA g(-1) current density, with 526.2 mAh g(-1) of specific capacity remained after 150 charge-discharge cycles. A high specific capacity of 497.3 mAh g(-1) was achieved at 3000 mA g(-1), which to our knowledge performs the best among most Sb-based anodes reported in the literature. This on top of its facile synthesis makes the Sb2O3@Sb composite a viable anode candidate for future sodium-ion batteries. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Recent advances on metal alkoxide-based electrocatalysts for water splitting
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
M3  - Review
AB  - Electrocatalytic water splitting to produce clean and sustainable hydrogen energy is regarded as a promising strategy to address the growing energy and environmental problems. Thus, the search for low-cost and efficient electrocatalysts plays a vital role in water electrolysis. In recent years, metal alkoxides, which are a series of organic-inorganic hybrid compounds, have attracted tremendous attention in energy research owing to their appealing features of high porosity, large surface area, adjustable composition and regulated hierarchical structures. However, the development of metal alkoxides towards electrocatalysis has not been established systematically. Herein, we review and discuss the recent advances on metal alkoxides and their derivatives (including hydroxides, oxides, phosphides, sulfides, and selenides) for electrocatalytic water splitting. The fundamental principles of how to regulate their composition, phases and hierarchical structures to enhance their performance are highlighted, also including their correlative structure-activity relationship. Finally, the issues and future challenges with the use of metal alkoxide-based nanomaterials for electrocatalytic applications are proposed. This review aims to present a comprehensive understanding of metal alkoxide-based electrocatalysts and some suggestions for the future development of high-performance electrocatalysts for water splitting applications.

TI  - Nanocomposite of graphene oxide with nitrogen-doped TiO2 exhibiting enhanced photocatalytic efficiency for hydrogen evolution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of hydrogen energy potentially addresses energy and environmental problems. In order to improve the photocatalytic efficiency, nanocomposite of N-doped TiO2 with graphene oxide (NTG) is prepared and characterized with Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscope (AFM), photoluminescent spectra. The application of NTG to hydrogen evolution exhibits high photocatalytic efficiency of 716.0 or 112.0 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) under high-pressure Hg or Xenon lamp, which is about 9.2 or 13.6 times higher than P25 photocatalyst. This is mainly attributed to the N-doping of TiO2 and the incorporation of graphene oxide resulting in narrow band gap, together with the synergistic effect of fast electron-transporting of photogenerated electrons and the efficient electron-collecting of graphene oxide retarding charge recombination. These results provide a significant theoretical foundation for the potential application of N-doping photocatalysts to hydrogen evolution. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

TI  - In situ preparation of N doped orthorhombic Nb2O5 nanoplates/rGO composites for photocatalytic hydrogen generation under sunlight
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The synthesis of nitrogen doped orthorhombic niobium oxide nanoplates/reduced graphene oxide composites (N-Nb2O5/rGO) and their photocatalytic activity towards hydrogen generation from water and H2S under natural sunlight has been demonstrated, uniquely. Nanostructured N-Nb2O5/rGO is synthesized by in situ wet chemical method using urea as a source of nitrogen and optimized by varying percentage of graphene oxide (GO). X-ray diffraction (XRD) study reveals that N-Nb2O5 have orthorhombic crystal structure with crystalline size, 35 nm. Further, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirm the presence of nitrogen and rGO in N-Nb2O5/rGO nanocomposite. Morphological features of (N-Nb2O5/rGO) were examined by FE-SEM and FE-TEM showed Nb2O5 nanoplates of diameter 25-40 nm anchored on 2D rGO. Diffuse reflectance spectra depicts the extended absorbance in the visible region with band gap of 2.2 eV. Considering the band gap in the visible region, the photocatalytic hydrogen generation from water and H2S has been performed. The 1 wt % rGO hybridized N-Nb2O5 (S2) exhibited superior photocatalytic hydrogen generation (537 mu mol/h) from water and (1385 mu mol/h) from H2S under sunlight. The improved photocatalytic activity is attributed due to an extended absorbance in the visible region, modified electronic structure upon doping and formation of well defined N-Nb2O5/rGO interface, provides large surface area, accelerates the supression of electron and hole pairs recombination rate. In our opinion, this works may provides facile route for energy efficient and economic approach for fabrication of N-Nb2O5/rGO nanocomposites as a visible light active photocatalyst.

TI  - A facile dissolution strategy facilitated by H2SO4 to fabricate a 2D metal-free g-C3N4/rGO heterojunction for efficient photocatalytic H-2 production
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A 2D g-C3N4 (pPCN)/rGO heterojunction for photocatalytic hydrogen production is fabricated by a facile dissolution strategy facilitated by H2SO4. The bulk g-C3N4 (CN) can be directly exfoliated into ultrathin protonated g-C3N4 (PCN) nanosheets under the assistance of H2SO4, and PCN can be further modified by rGO in a dissolved state under the electrostatic self-assembly process. The nanocomposite exhibits a large surface area (146.47 m(2)/g) and intimate contact interfaces between pPCN and rGO due to the specific synthesis method. Based on the DRS, PL and photoelectrochemical analyses, the introduction of rGO can greatly improve the light absorption and photogenerated charge carrier separation and transfer of g-C3N4. The optimal pPCN/2 wt% rGO nanocomposite shows an efficient photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate of 715 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) under visible light irradiation, which is 2.6 and 13 times higher than those obtained on pPCN and CN. In addition, a photocatalytic mechanism over a 2D pPCN/rGO heterojunction is proposed. This work offers a new effective strategy for fascinating g-C3N4-based nanocomposites with promising hydrogen generation. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The facile synthesis and design of noble metal-free efficient catalysts to accelerate the sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is still a big challenge for electrolytic water splitting. In that context, the preparation of efficient catalysts with superior catalytic activity from cheap raw materials on a large scale is crucial. Briefly, Ni/NiO/TiO2/rGO is designed using the environmental-friendly and easily up-scalable PECVD technique. This trinary composite presents significance in regulating the crystalline structure, composition and electronic properties towards superior HER and OER activity in acidic solution as bifunctional electrocatalysts for efficient water splitting. Together with the promising long-term stability and durability, Ni/NiO/TiO2/rGO displays excellent electrocatalytic activity towards HER with eta(10) of 130 my vs RHE and a Tafel slope of 40 mV/dec.

TI  - Unravelling the role of interface of CuOx-TiO2 hybrid metal oxide in enhancement of oxygen reduction reaction performance
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Energy security and clean energy are of increasing importance given the current scenario. Hence fuel cells and metal-air batteries are gaining significant attention in recent times. However, the major problem associated with these technologies is the sluggish nature of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the expense associated with the catalyst. This study reports nitrogen-doped carbon-supported CuOx/TiO2-based heterostructure (CuOx/TiO2- 10 wt%/NC-800) as an efficient, durable, and low-cost ORR catalyst. CuOx/TiO2-10 wt%/NC-800 catalyst is synthesized using a simple hydrothermal method. The ORR experiments are performed in an alkaline medium (0.1 M KOH). The catalyst has excellent ORR activity with onset potential and half-wave potential of 0.90 V and 0.80 V vs. RHE, respectively. It also shows outstanding limiting current density of 5.80 mA cm-2. The catalyst offers excellent stability (with 92% current retention after 24 h) and durability (only 25 mV half-wave po-tential shift after 2000 CV cycles). The catalyst follows the 4e- transfer process (n = 3.94) with rather nominal amount of hydrogen peroxide formation (3.5%). The enhanced ORR activity is attributed to the strong synergistic effect between CuOx/TiO2 and NC. The unique structure formation also helps to get excellent electronic conductivity, large surface area, appropriate porosity, and desirable interface charge transfer between CuOx and TiO2.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Surface modification of the p-type Cu2ZnSnS4 photocathode with n-type zinc oxide nanorods for photo-driven salt water splitting
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The sulfurization of co-sputtering Cu-Zn-Sn metal precursors was employed to prepare the quaternary copper-zinc-tin-sulphide (Cu2ZnSnS4, CZTS) photocathodes on substrates. Influence of [Zn]/[Sn] ratios in CZTS photocathodes on their phases, morphologies, and the efficiencies of photo-driven salt-water splitting was examined. Pristine p-type CZTS photocathodes showed the highest photo-driven performance of 0.61 mA cm(-2) in an electrolyte containing 1 M sodium chloride with the external bias kept at-1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. An n type zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorod arrays layer was then coated on the CZTS photocathode to improve its photo-driven salt-water splitting performance. The CZTS/ZnO photoelectrode had the best photo-driven performance of 1.87 mA cm(-2) in the 1 M NaCl solution under illumination with the external bias set at -1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. From results of electrochemical impedance spectra measurements for the samples in the electrolyte, the CZTS/ZnO sample had good photo-driven salt-water splitting performance due to its lowest charge transfer resistance and p-n junction formed at the sample. Intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectra results of samples indicated that the surface states at the CZTS/ZnO interface were the recombination centers with the electrons from the CZTS sample and holes from the ZnO and therefore improved its photo-driven salt-water splitting performance.

TI  - Efficient room temperature detection of H-2 gas by novel ZnFe2O4-Pd decorated rGO nanocomposite
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A rapid and efficient microwave assisted synthetic route was adopted for the synthesis of ZnFe2O4-Pd decorated rGO nanocomposite. The combination of tunable electrical property of rGO and excellent sensing capability of both Pd and ZnFe2O4 was taken in to account towards the high performance hydrogen gas sensing. The structural confirmation of the designed nanocomposite was carried out by various sophisticated characterization techniques like Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Transmission electron microscopy and N-2 adsorption-desorption analysis. The Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed the presence of both ZnFe2O4 and Pd nanoparticles distributed uniformly on the rGO surface and the average particle sizes of ZnFe2O4 and Pd were found to be 7-9 and 3-5 nm respectively. The crystalline nature of the nanocomposite was confirmed from the selected area electron diffraction pattern. The synthesized nanocomposite showed high sensitivity towards a wide range of H-2 gas concentrations (50-1000 ppm) (3.36 %-29.13 %). The effect of temperature (25-100 degrees C) on the sensing response of the designed nanocomposite was investigated. The sensor showed high response (11.43%) towards 200 ppm of H-2 gas selectively with fast response (18 s) and recovery time (39 s) at room temperature. The enhanced sensing behavior can be attributed to the combined effects of high surface area and electrical conductivity of rGO with high charge carrier mobility and high sensing ability of both ZnFe2O4 and Pd nanoparticles.

TI  - Effect of nitrogen and sulfur co-doping on the performance of electrochemical hydrogen storage of graphene
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, finding a solution to replace metal catalysts with inexpensive and available elements has been investigated extensively. Carbon nanomaterials doped with heteroatom such as (N, B and S) which do not have any metal content can provide sustainable materials with a remarkable electrocatalytic activity that can compete with their metal counterparts. Doped graphene has been considered as an electrode material for oxygen reduction reaction, supercapacitor and Li-ion batteries. In this present account, co-doped graphene with nitrogen and sulfur was studied in order to investigate their electrochemical hydrogen storage performance. The dual doped sample was prepared via a simple hydrothermal method, using thiourea as a nitrogen and sulfur source. The nitrogen and sulfur co-doped graphene (NSG) showed excellent electrical conductivity and electrochemical performance compared with the nitrogen doped graphene (NG) and graphene oxide (GO). Doping graphene with foreign atoms is a method to create a semiconducting gap in it and can act as an n-type semiconductor, therefore the electrochemical performance is remarkable when used as an electrode. According to the results by increasing the electrical conductivity of graphene, the storage capacity of hydrogen was increased. The discharge capacity of GO after 20 cycles was increased from 653 mAh/g to 1663 mAh/g (5.88 wt% hydrogen) and 2418 mAh/g (8.55 wt% hydrogen) in single doped graphene (NG) and co-doped graphene (NSG), respectively. The prepared samples were characterized via X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Brunauer-Emmet-Teller analysis (BET), vibration sample magnetometer (VSM) and infrared spectrum (FT-IR).

TI  - Highly efficient electrocatalytic oxidation of formic acid on palladium nanoparticles-graphitic carbon nitride composite
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The electrochemical formic acid oxidation reaction (FAO) is an anodic process of direct formic acid fuel cells. Carbon supported platinum (Pt/C) and Palladium (Pd/C) catalysts are widely used as anode materials for FAO. The CO poisoning of Pt/C and poor stability of Pd/C are main obstacles for its commercialization. We report here superior electrocatalytic activity of Palladium nanoparticles-carbon nitride composite (PdNPs/CNx) towards formic acid oxidation (FAO) with high mass activity (1640 mAmg(pd)(-1)) in acid media (0.5 M H2SO4) which is 7.2 times higher than that of commercial Pd/C catalyst. It also exhibited an outstanding stability for FAO (mass activity of this catalyst was 23 times higher than commercial Pd/C after 1000 cycles). (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - NiCoP nanoparticles encapsulated in cross-linked graphene aerogel to efficient hydrogen evolution reaction
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The structure of a cheap and high-efficient electrochemical catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) plays an essential impact in producing updatable hydrogen energy. Herein, we introduce a facile way to synthesize graphene aerogel inlaid with NiCoP nanoparticles (NiCoP-NPs@GA), which used seaweed biomass as precursors through a phosphorization route. In this work, graphene oxide (GO) with thin layer structure and carbon aerogel (CA) skeleton with a three-dimensional (3D) structure were connected in series to form a 3D-graphene aerogel (GA) as a composite material for conductive matrix. In addition, NiCoP nanoparticles (NiCoP-NPs) are uniformly encapsulated in GA nanoflakes, and the particles size can be controlled by the nanopores of the GA nanoflakes. The excellent 3D-GA matrix contains numerous open pores which can effectively circumvent volume expansion and aggregation of the NiCoP-NPs. Compared with NiCoP bulk, the NiCoP-NPs@GA demonstrated the advantages of larger specific surface areas and better HER overpotential function of only 109 m V with an operational density of 10 mA/cm(2), along with a less Tafel gradient of 63 mV/dec in 0.5 M H2SO4. Our protocol opens a new avenue for synthesis of many transition metal catalytic makings and provides a preliminary research for their potential function in industry.

TI  - The effect of Sn on platinum dispersion in Pt/graphene catalysts for the methanol oxidation reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sn-modified platinum catalysts are presently one of the most active catalysts for the room temperature electrooxidation of ethanol at low potentials. In this study, Pt-Sn/graphene catalysts containing different ratios of Pt and Sn were prepared by the solution-phase reduction. Microstructural characterization shows that metallic Pt, Pt-Sn alloy and tin dioxide (SnO2) nanoparticles are distributed on the graphene sheets in the synthetic process. In terms of the electrocatalytic properties, graphene-supported Pt-Sn catalysts exhibit much higher current densities with increasing Sn proportions. Its proved that the addition of Sn not only decreases catalyst particles growth and agglomeration, but also promotes methanol electrooxidation by geometric effects on expanding Pt's lattice spacing, causing a synergistic effect between Pt and Sn nanoparticles.

CL  - Univ Surrey, Guildford, ENGLAND
AB  - Seeking the efficient and robust electrocatalysts necessarily enhances performance of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Increasing the surface active sites is a means to improve the performance. Herein, we use the Ni0.85Se anchored on reduction of graphene oxide (Ni0.85Se/rGO) hybrid material skillfully established by one-step facile hydrothermal method as a robust and stable electrocatalyst applying to hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In terms of morphology, Ni0.85Se nanospheres composed of many nanosheets are uniformly distributed on the graphene sheet layer. We also detailedly analyze its properties. Based on the interaction between Ni0.85Se and rGO, and the roles of graphene are as a substrate to heighten conductivity, possesses more active surface area by limiting growth of Ni0.85Se, and increases dispersion for exposing more active surface area and enlarge ion/ electron transfer rate. In HER, the Ni0.85Se/rGO catalyst displays the overpotential of 128 mV with a common current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 91 mV dec(-1), an extremely low onset potential of 37 mV, outstanding stability that a high current retention of 97.7% after 1000 cycles and well long-term stability for 18 h, outperforming the capability of Ni0.85Se nanospheres in alkaline solution for HER. The above results indicate that the Ni0.85Se/rGO hybrid material is a good HER ability and non-noble metal electrocatalyst has potential value in HER. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Effects of graphene oxide and sacrificial reagent for highly efficient hydrogen production with the costless Zn(O,S) photocatalyst
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Searching for noble metal-free co-catalyst is still a strenuous part in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), as most of the great catalysts contain noble metals like the expensive platinum. The present work demonstrates a feasible synthesis method of Zn(O,S)/GO nano composite with graphene oxide (GO) to serve as an inexpensive co-catalyst. Raman spectra and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images clearly verified that GO was successfully loaded on the surface of Zn(O,S). This GO layer could effectively decrease the charge transfer resistance and promote the charge carrier separation for enhancing hydrogen production rate. By optimizing the GO content, the best hydrogen production rate of 2840 mu g h(-1) was achieved with Zn(O,S)/0.5 wt% GO catalyst under 16 W UV lamp with illumination light at a wavelength of 352 nm, which showed about two times higher for GO-free Zn(O,S). The effect of sacrificial reagent on the hydrogen production rate of Zn(O,S)/0.5 wt% GO catalyst was also evaluated. The sacrificial reagent showed the efficiency with the following trend: ethanol > methanol > isopropanol > ethylene glycol. The mechanism for enhancing hydrogen production rate is elucidated in this paper. We consider the simple synthesis method and its low cost to make Zn(O,S)/GO a great potential for practical application. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Recently, waste-generated nanomaterials have received a surge in consideration for energy production due to their excellent properties and eco-friendly effects. A plethora of literature has reported on the growing interest for the production of hydrogen (H2) by utilizing sunlight through water splitting and the recycling of bio-waste into organic catalysts. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no review on waste-derived nanocomposites for the production of H2. Herein, potential methods, modes of fabrication, and the efficacy of synthesized nanocomposites for H2 production have been highlighted. Distinct attention has been given to waste-generated nanocomposites, including a variety of graphene nanomaterials. Remarkable efforts have been made to fabricate biomass-derived nanomaterials and to optimize their reaction conditions and efficient use in energy production.

TI  - Sequence-Designed Peptide Nanofibers Bridged Conjugation of Graphene Quantum Dots with Graphene Oxide for High Performance Electrochemical Hydrogen Peroxide Biosensor
T2  - ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES
M3  - Article
AB  - Motif-designed peptide molecules have the unique property to form filamentous nanostructure and the ability to conjugate with other nanoscale building blocks such as graphene and nanoparticles to create functional nanomaterials. Here, the design of a novel functional peptide molecule is reported, which has the abilities to form peptide nanofibers (PNFs) and recognize with graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and graphene oxide (GO) nanosheet specifically. Based on the design of peptide sequence, the ternary GQD-PNF-GO nanohybrids are synthesized successfully. The created ternary GQD-PNFGO nanohybrids are characterized by transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM). To understand the formation mechanism of this ternary nanostructure, the interactions between GQD, PNF, and GO are further investigated by AFM-based force spectroscopy. Moreover, it is found that the synthesized ternary GQD-PNF-GO nanohybrids show potential applications for high performance electrochemical hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) biosensor. This fabricated biosensor exhibits high sensitivity and selectivity, low detection limit, and wide linear range for sensing H2O2. It is believed that the strategies shown in this work such as the motif design of peptide and its self-assembly on GO will benefit the further creation of functional binary and ternary nanomaterials, as well as the understanding of their self-assembly and formation mechanisms.

TI  - Ultrafine palladium nanoparticles anchoring graphene oxide-ionic liquid grafted chitosan self-assembled materials: The novel organic-inorganic hybrid catalysts for hydrogen generation in hydrolysis of ammonia borane
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The novel graphene oxide-ionic liquid grafted chitosan composites (denoted as GO-ILCS) are firstly prepared via a self-assembly process. Then, they are used to anchor ultrafine palladium nanoparticles by the in-situ reduction of palladium chloride with sodium borohydride. The resultant Pd(0)/GO-ILCS organic-inorganic hybrid catalysts are characterized by various techniques and used to catalyze the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane (NH3BH3, AB) under ambient conditions. The results reveal that the palladium nanoparticles are highly dispersed on GO-ILCS and the Pd(0)/GO-ILCS catalysts exhibit high catalytic activity and excellent reusability in the reaction. The turnover frequency (TOF) is as high as 25.6 mol(H2), center dot mol(Pd)(-1)center dot min(-1) and the catalytic activity does not decrease obviously after six runs. The orders of palladium and AB concentrations are 1.00 and 0.33 in the catalytic reaction, respectively. Notably, the activation energy of the reaction (Ea = 38 kJ mol(-1)) over the resultant catalysts is obviously lower than most of the palladium-based catalysts reported previously. It is expected the Pd(0)/GO-ILCS catalysts are of exciting potential in the field of hydrogen energy. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and elemental mapping were carried out in the characterization of the prepared bentonite/TiO2/Au nanocomposite. The surface and chemical properties of the acquired nanocomposite were analyzed by BrunauerEmmett-Teller and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, respectively. Electrochemical measurement was performed on stainless steel mesh prefabricated electrodes in 1 M KOH electrolyte solution. The B-T/Au nanocomposite prepared under 12 min laser irradiation displayed the highest hydrogen storage capacity (15 Cg(-1)). (c) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A novel TiO2(B) confined in porous bio-derived carbon has been prepared for dehydrogenated catalyzation of NH3BH3. The microstructural characterizations of as-prepared samples show that the nanoconfinement in well-organized micro/mesopores of carbon can avoid the aggregations of TiO2(B) nanoparticles and NH3BH3. The dehydrogenation measurement demonstrates the dehydrogenated thermodynamic and dynamic properties of NH3BH3 could be improved under the con-catalyzation of TiO2(B) and porous carbon.

TI  - The individual role of pyrrolic, pyridinic and graphitic nitrogen in the growth kinetics of Pd NPs on N-rGO followed by a comprehensive study on ORR
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to develop and replace the expensive PtC catalyst from the fuel cells, we have attempted to synthesize an efficient catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in an alkaline media. The materials were initially fabricated as follows; (a) synthesizing a nitrogen doped (para-xylylenediamine, nitrogen precursor) graphene oxide (N-rGO); (b) synthesizing palladium nanoparticles on graphene oxide surface (rGO-Pd). The electrochemical analysis showed that the ORR path on the N-rGO catalyst is observed to follow 2-electron mechanism. Conversely, the onset potential, current density and surface area of the rGO-Pd doesn't match with the commercially available PtC catalyst. To overcome these flaws, we have combined the individual effects of each component and fabricated N-rGO-Pd nano composite. The covalent interaction between nitrogen part of para-xylylenediamine with oxygenated functionalities of GO, followed by a strong pi-pi stacking interaction between the aromatic ring of para-xylylenediamine and GO altered the electronic distribution of the carbon support, induced more defects, influenced the size and averted the self agglomeration of the Pd NPs which lead to the astonishing catalytic activity of N-rGO-Pd catalyst. Furthermore, various spectroscopic techniques revealed the individual influence of pyrrolic, pyridinic and graphitic N on the synthesis, size and extraordinary distribution of Pd NPs.

AB  - Nickel-Tungsten-Graphene oxide (Ni-W-GO) composite coating was developed through direct electrolysis method, and its electrocatalytic activity for alkaline water splitting reaction was studied. The development of composite coating with a homogeneous dispersion of GO was achieved using an optimal Ni-W plating bath loaded with GO. The electrocatalytic efficacy of the coating for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was tested using cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry techniques in 1.0 M KOH medium. The variation in electrocatalytic activity with the addition of GO was studied. A significant increase in the electrocatalytic activity towards HER was found. The improvement in electrocatalytic activity of Ni-W-GO composite coating was ascribed to the intersticed GO nanoparticles in the alloy matrix, evidenced by different advanced methods of analyses, like Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD).

TI  - Highly-dispersed Ru nanoparticles sputtered on graphene for hydrogen production
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A physical sputtering method was adopted to prepare graphene supported highly dispersed and uniform sized Ru NPs without using any solutions, surfactants and reductants. The Ru/G-spu exhibited excellent catalytic performance for HER and hydrolytic dehydrogenation of NaBH4. Especially for HER in alkaline media, it performed superior electrocatalytic activity over Pt/C. The superior catalytic performance can be attributed to the high exposed surface area and dispersion of Ru NPs on graphene with the open 2D layer structure, which demonstrates the physical sputtering method is a facile and efficient technique to prepare graphene supported metal NPs with excellent structure and catalytic properties.

TI  - Monodisperse PtCu alloy nanoparticles as highly efficient catalysts for the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Pt-M alloy nanoparticles (NPs) with well-defined size and compositions exhibit dramatically catalytic performance in chemical reactions. In this work, monodisperse PtCu NPs with controlled size and compositions were synthesized by the co-reduction method in the presence of oleylamine. These NPs have excellent catalytic activities in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane (AB) and their activities were composition dependent. Among the different-composition PtCu NPs, the CusoPtso NPs exhibit the highest catalytic activity with an initial turnover frequency of 102.5 mol((hydrogen)) . mol((catalyst))(-1) . min(-1) and an apparent activation energy of 36 kJ.mol(-1), which demonstrate the validity of partly replacing Pt by a first-row transition metal on constructing high performance heterogeneous nanocatalysts for the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of AB.

TI  - Electrocatalytic Activity of Graphene Oxide/Metal Organic Framework Hybrid Composite on Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Properties
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, the electrocatalytic activity of graphene oxide (GO) and its composite with metal organic framework (MOF) towards electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was studied. GO/MOF composite was synthesized by impregnation route and characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), simultaneous thermal analysis (STA), scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (HR-TEM/EDX). STA analysis showed an enhancement of the thermal stability of the GO/MOF composite compared to the pristine GO and MOF. SEM/EDS and HR-TEM/EDX confirmed the presence of octahedral structure of MOF in the GO sheet-like structure and elemental composition of the synthesized compounds. The performance of the proposed electrolytic system for electrochemical HER by Tafel parameters and turn over frequencies (TOFs) showed a huge increment of H-2 production in the composite through the Volmer reaction together with either of the two mechanisms in HER. This indicated that the addition of GO/MOF in the electrolytic system possessed better catalytic characteristics with enhanced TOFs, which may open a new way for hydrogen technology via HER enhancement.

TI  - Co-Mo nanoparticles loaded on three-dimensional graphene oxide as efficient catalysts for hydrogen generation from catalytic hydrolysis of sodium borohydride
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 16th International Symposium on Metal-Hydrogen Systems (MH)
CL  - Guangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Co-Mo particles were loaded on three dimensional graphene oxide (3DGO) carrier via a chemical reduction method to get a composite catalyst, Co-Mo/3DGO, for hydrogen generation from NaBH4 hydrolysis. Hydrolysis measurement shows that the ratio Co:Mo = 0.7:0.3 realizes a much higher hydrogen generation rate (HGR) of 7023.3mL(H2).min(-1).g(M)(-1), about 1.6 times of that for the Mo element undoped Co/3DGO (4394 mL(H2).min(-1).g(M)(-1) ) catalyst. And the reaction activation energy is as low as 35.6 kJ mol(-1). The as prepared Co0.7Mo0.3/3DGO catalyst disperses on 3DGO surface as smaller particles than Co/3DGO, and presents a waxberry like structure with more active sites for catalysis reaction, which enables the catalyst a superior catalytic activity. Besides abundant active sites, MoO3 supported active blend of Co and CoO is another reason for the higher activity. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Hierarchical 3D ZnIn2S4/graphene nano-heterostructures: their in situ fabrication with dual functionality in solar hydrogen production and as anodes for lithium ion batteries
T2  - PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hierarchical 3D ZnIn2S4/graphene (ZnIn2S4/Gr) nano-heterostructures were successfully synthesized using an in-situ hydrothermal method. The dual functionality of these nano-heterostructures i.e. for solar hydrogen production and lithium ion batteries has been demonstrated for the first time. The ZnIn2S4/Gr nano-heterostructures were optimized by varying the concentrations of graphene for utmost hydrogen production. An inspection of the structure shows the existence of layered hexagonal ZnIn2S4 wrapped in graphene. The reduction of graphene oxide (GO) to graphene was confirmed by Raman and XPS analyses. The morphological analysis demonstrated that ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanopetals are dispersed on graphene sheets. The optical study reveals the extended absorption edge to the visible region due to the presence of graphene and hence is used as a photocatalyst to transform H2S into eco-friendly hydrogen using solar light. The ZnIn2S4/Gr nano-heterostructure that is comprised of graphene and ZnIn2S4 in a weight ratio of 1 : 99 exhibits enhanced photocatalytically stable hydrogen production i.e. B6365 mmole h(-1) under visible light irradiation using just 0.2 g of nano-heterostructure, which is much higher as compared to bare hierarchical 3D ZnIn2(S4). The heightened photocatalytic activity is attributed to the enhanced charge carrier separation due to graphene which acts as an excellent electron collector and transporter. Furthermore, the usage of nano-heterostructures and pristine ZnIn2S4 as anodes in lithium ion batteries confers the charge capacities of 590 and 320 mA h g(-1) after 220 cycles as compared to their initial reversible capacities of 645 and 523 mA h g(-1), respectively. These nano-heterostructures show high reversible capacity, excellent cycling stability, and high-rate capability indicating their potential as promising anode materials for LIBs. The excellent performance is due to the nanostructuring of ZnIn2S4 and the presence of a graphene layer, which works as a channel for the supply of electrons during the charge-discharge process. More significantly, their dual functionality in energy generation and storage is quite unique and commendable.

TI  - A nanostructured Ni/graphene hybrid for enhanced electrochemical hydrogen storage
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
M3  - Article
AB  - To fabricate electrochemical hydrogen storage materials with delaminated structure, the graphene oxide (GO) in the ethylene glycol solution was reassembled in the presence of the precursor of Ni nanoparticles, and then, the reassembled hybrid was reduced under hydrogen atmosphere to obtain Ni/graphene hybrid. X-ray diffraction patterns and X-ray absorption spectscopic (XAS) analysis clearly show that Ni nanoparticles in Ni/graphene hybrid maintain its nanosized nature even after hybridization with graphene nanosheet (GNS). According to the TEM analysis, the Ni nanoparticles with an average size of 5.2 nm are homogeneously distributed onto the GNS in such a way that the nanoporous structure with much amount of void spaces could be fabricated. The obtained Ni/GNS exhibits a hydrogen storage capacity of 160 mA h/g, while the specific capacity of the graphene nanosheet was only 21 mA h/g. A flexible delaminated structure of Ni/GNS nanocomposite could provide additional intercalation sites for accommodation of hydrogen, leading to the enhancement of hydrogen storage capacity.

TI  - Performance of crosslinked sodium alginate/sulfonated graphene oxide as polymer electrolyte membrane in DMFC application: RSM optimization approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - DMFC received great consideration since it was developed due to its efficiency in electricity production and easy start-up and process. The selectivity of sodium alginate-based membrane as a function of sulfonated graphene oxide and glycerol content is analysed using response surface methodology. It is observed that the properties of the membrane are strongly influenced by the glycerol and sulfonated graphene oxide loading in order to produce the optimum morphology and conducting properties, thus affecting the selectivity of the membrane and consequently the overall performance of the direct methanol fuel cell. The objective of this study is to determine the parameters that significantly affecting the performance of the membrane. Two parameters were taken into consideration that is the weight percentage of sulfonated graphene oxide and glycerol loadings. Both are determined approximately 0.5 wt% to 5 wt% and 0.5 ml-6.0 ml, respectively. The best selectivity result is achieved by using SA/SGO biomembrane with loadings of 2.78 wt% SGO and 3.11 ml of glycerol, respectively. The selectivity is determined as 12.956 x 10(4) S scm(-3). This study proves that the sulfonated graphene oxide and glycerol improved the final membrane structures and performances of the membrane based on numerical analysis, the observation from field emission scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscope structural analysis as well as the performance of direct methanol fuel cell.

TI  - Photocatalytic water splitting hydrogen production via environmental benign carbon based nanomaterials
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Environmentally benign hydrogen production via photochemical and photo electrochemical processes by water splitting using carbon-based nanomaterials utilizes sunlight as the source of energy. Owing to their large surface area, pore volume, chemical and thermal stability, and favorable morphology, the carbon-based nanomaterials are quite effective in photocatalytic water splitting. The present review elucidates the photo catalytic nature of carbon materials such as graphene, graphene oxide, carbon nanotubes, graphitic carbon nitride, and fullerenes as they have the tendency to narrow the band gap, allocate electrons, and act as semiconductors, co-catalysts, photosensitizers, and support materials. The production methods, advantages as well as shortcomings of carbon-based materials and their applications in hydrogen production are critically discussed. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB  - A highly efficient electrode for ethanol electrooxidation was successfully fabricated with the assistance of Nanoimprint Lithography (creation of 3D structure) and facile preparation method-electrodeposition. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterize the electrodes obtained, which were further evaluated by Cyclic Voltammetry Potentiostat. It concludes that the electrocatalytic activity of the electrodes towards ethanol oxidation is promoted in the sequence of Au < Au/rGO < Au/rGO/CoPt3. The synergy effect of reduced GO and CoPt3 nanoparticle along with highly active gold thin layer forming 3D structure is responsible for the significant improvement of the catalysis.

TI  - One-step fabrication of new generation graphene-based electrodes for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells by a novel electrophoretic deposition
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - High Pt loading has better tradeoff in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) in terms of improved performance and operational longevity. But, to employ low amounts of Pt electrocatalysts via an alternative carbon-based support and utilization technique is vital. This study presents the use of a one-step novel technique, an electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method, through which reduced graphene oxide (rGO) supported Pt nanoparticles have been directly fabricated onto carbon paper to form electrodes for PEMFC. Our process involves simultaneous synthesis and deposition of Pt-reduced GO nanocomposites onto oxygen plasma pre-treated carbon paper in an organo-aqueous media at various deposition time. Through this technique, homogenously distributed Pt nanoparticles ranging from 5 to 6 nm in size on graphene support were successfully syn-thesized to form catalyst layer on carbon paper. The characteristics of fabricated electrodes were investigated ex-situ by Raman spectroscopy, FE-SEM, XPS, ICP, FIB, TEM. Furthermore, catalytic activity towards hydrogen oxidation reaction was evaluated via CV measurements and fuel cell performance tests were also conducted. The highest ECSA value of 27.4 m(2)g(-1) and the Pt utilization efficiency of 1.48 kW/g(Pt)(-1)- were achieved at an optimized Pt loading of 0.129 mg cm(-2). A maximum power density of 280 mW cm(-2) was obtained with increasing EPD time and Pt precursor concentration at the same time. The achieved results are attributed to the dispersion of Pt nanoparticles on rGO nanosheets displaying synergetic performance as catalyst necessary for PEMFCs, thanks to the EPD technique's viability, ease in handling, and reproducibility in the synthesis route. In the previous studies on Pt/GO based fuel cell electrodes by EPD, on one hand, Pt NPs were synthesized on GO by chemical methods first and electrodes were fabricated by a subsequent EPD. On the other hand, the fuel cell performances of those electrodes have been rarely shown. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time in literature not only about the use of EPD technique for the fabrication of fuel cell electrodes in one-step but also the evaluation of fuel cell performance of the electrodes fabricated by EPD.

TI  - Heterogeneous CoFe-Co8FeS8 nanoparticles embedded in CNT networks as highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction
T2  - JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - It is essential to explore high-efficiency and low-cost electrocatalysts to replace noble metal based electrocatalysts for promoting the efficiency of water splitting and obtaining clean hydrogen energy. Herein, for the first time, self-assembled heterogeneous CoFe-Co8FeS8 nanoparticles embedded in CNT networks (CoFe/Co8FeS8/CNT) are synthesized via a facile microwave-assisted sulfidation and annealing process. Compared to CoFe/CNT or Co8FeS8/CNT, the CoFe/Co8FeS8/CNT delivers much better performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER): it shows an Ultralow Tafel slope of 38 mV dec(-1); it affords a large current density of 10 mA cm(-2) only requiring a small overpotential of 290 mV; in addition, it demonstrates good long-term stability. The outstanding OER performance of CoFe/Co8FeS8/CNT is attributed to its unique porous nanoarchitecture constructed by heterogeneous CoFe-Co8FeS8 nanoparticles homogenously embedded in highly conductive CNT networks, which can not only enable full utilization of electrocatalytic active sites and provide conductive pathways for efficient charge transfer between nanoparticles and CNT, but also accelerate gas bubbles evolving and releasing. This work provides insight into microwave-assisted synthesis of highly efficient non-precious transition metal sulfide based electrocatalysts with rationally designed nanoarchitecture for OER.

TI  - Development of Noval Electrocatalyst Based on Graphene Supported Palladium-cobalt Nanoparticles as Hydrogen Evolution Catalyst for the Cost Effective Production of Hydrogen from Methanol
T2  - ELECTROANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Production of hydrogen using conventional water electrolysis is not the convenient and effective way due to slow oxidation evaluation at the anode electrode. Electroreforming of organic substances such as methanol to generate hydrogen has been considered an innovative strategy. Herein, graphene (G) supported Pd-3-Co-1(Pd-3-Co(1/)G) catalyst was synthesized and employed as cathode catalyst to facilitate hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the electrochemical methanol reformation (ECMR) process. The structural characteristics of synthesized Pd-3-Co-1/G were determined by FE-SEM, HR- LEM, EDX, XRD, FT-IR, UV, XPS, and ICP-OES techniques. Furthermore, the electrocatalytic behavior of the proposed catalyst was evaluated by CV, LSV and EIS techniques in 0.5 M H2SO4. Electrochemical studies revealed that Pd-3-Co-1/G exhibited a large electrochemically active surface area (120 m(2) g(-1)), good long-term stability, low Tafel slope value (46 mV dec(-1)) and small WI value (12 Omega). The practical utility of the developed catalyst towards hydrogen production in ECMR cell was tested at various experimental conditions using membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) which were prepared using commercial Pt-Ru/C as anode and Pd-3-Co-1/G as cathode electrocatalysts respectively. The synthesized Pd-3-Co-1/G electrocatalyst exhibited superior cell performance for 50 h at 60 degrees C cell temperature with a cell voltage and current density of 058 V and 150 mAcm(-2), respectively. The improvement in electrocatalytic activity could be attributed to alloying Pd with Co and the use of G as carbon support, which in turn enhanced the HER activity of Pd. Hence, the prepared Pd-3-Co(1/)G can be used as an alternative to cathode electrocatalyst for HER in ECMR cells.

TI  - Catalytic transfer hydrogenation of nitro compounds into amines over magnetic graphene oxide supported Pd nanoparticles
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The hydrogenation of nitro compounds into amines is of great importance both from academic and industrial points. In this study, graphene oxide was simultaneously decorated by Fe3O4 and Pd nanoparticles to generate magnetic C-Fe3O4-Pd catalyst, which showed high catalytic activity towards the transfer hydrogenation of nitro compounds by the use of NaBH4 as the hydrogen donor at room temperature. Aniline was produced in a high yield of 99% after 30 min at 25 degrees C. A wide variety of substituted nitroarenes with other reducible groups were also successfully converted into the corresponding amines with high yields. Kinetic studies revealed the active energy of the transfer hydrogenation of nitrobenzene was 31.1 kJ mol(-1). One of the main reasons of the high catalytic activity of the C-Fe3O4-Pd catalyst was due to the fact that the catalyst showed high ability to absorb the substrate on its surface. The transfer hydrogenation of nitrobenzene was confirmed to proceed via azobenzene as the intermediate. More importantly, the catalyst was very stable without the loss of its catalytic activity.

AB  - A series of nitrogen-doped graphene nanocomposites (N-RGO) derived from pyrolysis of graphene oxide (GO)/polyaniline composites with varied mass ratio between GO and aniline were used as support for immobilization of Pt nanoparticles. Transmission electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to characterize the morphology and microstructure of the prepared catalysts. The catalytic activity of the catalysts towards the oxidation of methanol was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry. Compared to the undoped Pt/RGO catalyst, an enhanced electrocatalytic activity for methanol oxidation was obtained in the case of the Pt/N-RGO with optimized composition and nanostructure.

TI  - Facile fabrication of PtPd alloyed worm-like nanoparticles for electrocatalytic reduction of oxygen
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Alloying platinum with a second metal such as palladium can increase the mass activity of Pt and lower the usage of expensive Pt elements, hence is of great importance for designing highly efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In this study, monomorphic PtPd alloyed worm-like nanoparticles (PtPd WNPs) with dominant (111) facets were prepared with a facile one-pot approach. The detailed morphology, composition, and surface structure of the PtPd WNPs were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), selected-area electron diffraction (SAED), energy dispersive spectrum (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), as well as Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The prepared PtPd WNPs displayed enhanced electrocatalytic activity and remarkably robust stability toward ORR in both alkaline and acidic media, superior than commercial Pt/C catalysts. This strategy may open a new route to design and prepare advanced electrocatalysts for fuel cells. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A highly flexible and conductive graphene-wrapped carbon nanofiber membrane for high-performance electrocatalytic applications
T2  - INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The integration of conventional carbonaceous materials with advanced two-dimensional graphene is a challenging but worthwhile attempt to introduce innovative properties into new composites. Herein, we report a novel and facile strategy to create graphene wrapped electrospun carbon nanofiber (GwC) membranes through the surface-induced assembly of graphene oxide (GO) on the surface of pre-oxidized electrospun PAN (oPAN) nanofibers and subsequent carbonization. Driven by the hydrogen bonding between oxygen-containing groups of GO and tertiary amino groups of oPAN, GwC composite membranes with significantly reinforced electrical conductivity are obtained in which every single oPAN fiber is tightly and evenly wrapped by graphene sheets. Additionally, the GwC membrane is further considered as a free-standing template for an in situ growth of few-layered MoSe2 nanosheets. Compared with the graphene-free counterparts, GwC-MoSe2 composites exhibit a superior electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance in both acidic and alkaline solutions due to the highly conductive GwC back-bone, thus endowing the newly designed GwC membranes with various possibilities for applications in energy-related fields.

TI  - Novel synthesis of graphene oxide/In2S3/TiO2 NRs heterojunction photoanode for enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Novel heterostructure photocatalyst built from titanium dioxide (TiO2), graphene oxide (GO) and indium sulfide (In2S3) has been successfully prepared for photoelectrochemical hydrogen production. The stepwise introduction of three materials on conductive glass substrate has been realized through hydrothermal, electrochimical and spin coating deposition methods, respectively. The structure, morphology, composition, optical and photoelectrochemical properties of the resultant photoanodes were investigated in detail. The presence of GO in the heterostructure film was confirmed by Raman analysis with D and G band intensity. Surface morphology analysis of the GO/In2S3/TiO2 NRs structure reveal the homogenous distribution of graphene oxide on In2S3/TiO2 NRs surface. From UV-Vis analysis, band gap energy of the samples decreases gradually from 3.34 eV (TiO2 NRs) to 3.12 eV, with In2S3 and GO addition. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) further confirmed that GO/In2S3/TiO2 NRs heterostructure possessed the lowest charge-transfer resistance, revealing that In2S3 and GO could significantly accelerate the electron mobility compared with bare TiO2. From Mott-Schottky plots, several parameters such as flat-band potential and free carrier concentration were determined. Next, The GO/In2S3/TiO2 NRs electrode achieved remarkably improved current density (0.45 mAcm(2) at 0.8 V vs Ag/AgCl) compared to pure TiO2 NRs or In2S3/TiO2 NRs electrodes, which attributes to the uniform structure and excellent electrical conductivity of GO, which could reduce the combination rate of the photo electron-hole pairs. These results reveal that GO/In2S3/TiO2 NRs possesses great potential toward the development of newly synthesizable catalysts in the field of photoelectrochemical water splitting.

AB  - Magnetic chitosan (CS-Fe3O4) was synthesized via a co-precipitation method and used as supports to anchor palladium nanoparticles (Pd(0)/CS-Fe3O4) by chemical reduction of PdCl2 with NaBH4. The results showed that the nanosized palladium particles were highly dispersed onto CS-Fe3O4 and the resulting Pd(0)/CS-Fe3O4 catalysts exhibited high catalytic activity and good recyclability for the hydrolysis of ammonia borane (NH3BH3, AB). The turnover frequency (TOF) of the catalysts was as high as 15.0 mol(H2)center dot mol(pd)(-1)center dot min(-1) at 30 degrees C and the catalytic activity had not obvious decrease even after eight recycle experiments. The results of kinetic experiments showed that the activation energy of the reaction (E-a)is 35.94 kJ mol(-1) The orders of palladium and AB concentrations in the catalytic reaction were 0.70 and 0.62, respectively.

TI  - Palladium nanoparticles from surfactant/fast-reduction combination one-pot synthesis for the liquid fuel cell applications
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We report a facile one-pot synthesis of well-dispersed Pd nanoparticles on a carbon nanofiber (CNF) support, achieved via the unique sequential processes of supramolecular self-assembly and fast reduction of the Pd source. Pd ions attached to the sulfate ends of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) molecules self-assembled on a CNF, and subsequent fast reduction suppressed particle coarsening, in contrast to the slow reduction processes in previous works. The particle size and dispersion uniformity were comparable to those of particles synthesized by combined SDS/high-energy irradiation. The Pd nanoparticles prepared using the present one-pot approach were superior or comparable to those obtained using non-one-pot approaches in previous works in terms of electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability in the electrooxidation of liquid fuels at the anodes of direct formic acid, direct methanol, and direct ethanol fuel cells.

AB  - Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are synthesized by one pot electrochemical method using small molecule and applied as the support materials for platinum (Pt) catalysts. The effect of CQD on the catalytic activity and stability of the supported Pt catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction is investigated for the first time. The as-prepared Pt/CQD nano composites has been carefully characterized by spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques. X-ray diffractometer and tunneling electron microscopy techniques are employed to study the crystallite size. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that Pt deposited to CQD.The electrochemical behavior, characterized by oxygen reduction reaction onset potentials, electrochemical active surface area, cyclic voltammetry stability (1000 cycles) and charge transfer resistance is attributed to the strong interaction between the nanosize platinum particles and the CQDs composite, which induces modulation in the electronic structure of the platinum clusters.

M3  - Article
AB  - Platinum-based catalysts are ineluctable and superior among the various other HER-efficient electrocatalysts. Enhancing the electrocatalytic activity by reducing the amount of Pt is highly challenging. In this work, a systematic physicochemical and electrochemical study on platinum nano-islands (Pt NIs) architectured on three-dimensional nanocarbon hybrid (3D-NCHy) was carried out. A detailed comparison of the catalyst activity with respect to Pt decorated on other carbon nanostructures has been evaluated. Pt NIs@3D-NCHy demonstrated substantially high degree of stability and durability during the electrochemical evaluations. The electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) studies were carried out using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), Tafel polarization, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Pt NIs@3D-NCHy catalyst exhibited lowest overpotential value of -13mV for attaining a current density of -10mAcm(-2). The stability and durability of the catalyst was tested by continuous accelerated degradation test (ADT) for 10,000cycles, and a high degree of stability was observed for the material. The turnover frequency (TOF) was estimated to be 6.3s(-1) at an overpotential (?)=-70mV. Interesting, the as-synthesized hybrid with a Pt loading of 3.8 mu gcm(-2), established performance equivalence to that of 20wt.% Pt/C which has Pt loading of 20 mu gcm(-2).

TI  - Platinum-palladium nanoparticles-loaded on N-doped graphene oxide/polypyrrole framework as a high performance electrode in ethanol oxidation reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Existing catalysts for ethanol oxidation in direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFC) are faced to significant challenges due to their poor performance and CO like intermediates poisoning tolerance at anode surface. Hence researchers are looking for new electrocatalysts in the ethanol oxidation. In this study, polypyrrole/N-doped graphene oxide (PPy/NGO) nano composite was prepared using in-situ polymerization method. Next the platinum palladium (Pt-Pd) was electrochemically decorated on PPy/NGO nanocomposite surface. In order to ensure the correct preparation of nanocomposite, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis was carried out to peruse the chemical structure of the nanocomposite and also to investigate their morphology, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used. The morphology of nano composite shows that PPy has penetrated into the space between NGO plates. Disparate electrochemical techniques like cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and chronoamperometry (CA) were employed to evaluate the oxidation of ethanol. Results showed that Pt-Pd/PPy/NGO exhibits improved electrocatalytic activity and stability for ethanol oxidation. Enhanced active surface area of the Pt Pd/PPy/NGO electrode (35.1 m(2) g(-1) contributes to increase in current density and decrease in over potential values in the ethanol oxidation as compared to Pt-Pd electrocatalyst.

TI  - Methanol electrocatalytic oxidation over Pt nanoparticles anchoring on three-dimensional carbon nanosheet rich in oxygen functional groups
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, three-dimensional carbon nanosheets (CS) were treated at different temperatures in an atmosphere of ozone, then obtained a series of Pt/OCS-X catalysts through the loading of Pt, including Pt/CS, Pt/OCS-25, Pt/OCS-90, Pt/OCS-160 and Pt/OCS-200. To prove that ozone oxidation can effectively improve the activity of the catalyst, these catalysts were tested by methanol electrocatalytic oxidation reaction (MOR). It is discovered that ozone treatment could greatly increase the number of oxygen-containing functional groups, and the HO-C=O content was greatly improved after the modulation of treated temperature. It is discovered that the Pt/OCS-160 sample exhibits the best activity with a peak current density of 37.7 mA cm(-2) at the forward scan due to the excellent lamellar structure, good crystallinity, and abundant pore structure of CS, which is a benefit to form ultrahigh specific surface area, superb electron, and ionic conductivity. Meanwhile, the capacity of anti-poisoning of Pt/CS after O-3 treatment is enhanced obviously. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, ternary P25/GO/Pt hybrid photocatalysts are prepared in different orders, using Degussa's TiO2 (P25), graphene oxide (GO), chloroplatinic acid as precursor. The prepared catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). This work is first time to compare the hydrogen production of the ternary P25/GO/Pt hybrid photocatalysts prepared in different orders. We focus on studying the introduction of GO and find that the quantity of introduced GO and electronic transfer path play an important role in photocatalytic activity on ternary P25/GO/Pt hybrid catalysts. When the proper Pt particle loaded on the flat surface of GO which was 0.5wt% of P25, the highest H-2 evolution was obtained. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

TI  - Investigation on the existence of optimum interlayer distance for H-2 uptake using pillared-graphene oxide
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to prove the existence of an optimum interlayer distance for H-2 uptake, we have obtained H-2 isotherms with respect to the interlayer distance of pillared-graphene oxide (GO) at 1.0 bar and 77 K. Interlayer distances of GO were changed by intercalation of three kinds of diaminoalkanes with a different number of carbon atoms (NH2(CH2)(n)NH2, n = 2, 6, 10) as pillars and changing the subsequent thermal annealing conditions. We found an optimum GO interlayer distance for maximum H-2 uptake at 6.3 angstrom similar to the predicted distance from first-principles calculations for graphitic materials, and the value obtained from thermally modulated GO. Our results experimentally corroborate the existence of an optimum interlayer distance and demonstrate the importance of an interlayer distance for the design of materials for H-2 storage.

TI  - Ionic liquids-noncovalently functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes decorated with palladium nanoparticles: A promising electrocatalyst for ethanol electrooxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A new palladium-based electrocatalyst (Pd/PDIL-MWCNTs) with ionic liquids molecules derived from 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic acid (PDIL) noncovalently functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (PDIL-MWCNTs) decorated with palladium nanoparticles is fabricated through a facile and surfactant-free synthetic technique. Due to the introduction of PDIL molecules, the Pd/PDIL-MWCNTs remarkably possesses smaller mean nano particles (NPs) size, better distribution of Pd NPs and larger electrochemical active surface area than the Pd NPs immobilized on the MWCNTs and the harsh acid treated MWCNTs (AO-MWCNTs). Furthermore, the Pd/PDIL-MWCNTs exhibits the enhanced electrocatalytic activity and improved stability for ethanol electrooxidation compared with Pd/MWCNTs and Pd/A0-MWCNTs, owing to the role of PDIL functional molecules. Additionally, a possible synergistic mechanism of PDIL-MWCNTs and Pd NPs for ethanol electrooxidation is also proposed on the basis of the previous literatures and the experimental results. The results indicate that the PDIL-MWCNTs is a promising support for electrocatalyst and the Pd/PDIL-MWCNTs catalyst may be a well candidate for direct ethanol alkaline fuel cells.

TI  - Fabrication of three-dimensional nanocomposite with open cage fullerene polymer and MoS2 for enhanced electrochemical hydrogen evolution activity
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Development of advanced materials for electrocatalytic water splitting to generate hydrogen is the key in utilization of renewable energy. In the present work, we constructed three-dimensional (3D) nanoparticles (P-PC60@MoS2) based on an open-cage fullerene polymer (P-PC60), on the surface of which two-dimensional (2D) molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) are grafted vertically. The rational design endows the nanocomposite materials with combined advantages of open-cage fullerenes and MoS2. Especially, compared with traditional fullerenes, polymeric fullerene derivatives are expected to have remarkable electronic, optical, or catalytic properties due to the formation of an interconnected continuous network. The results indicate that the few-layer MoS2 slices arranged vertically on the surface of the fullerene, showing an expanded layer spacing of 6.4 angstrom, which is beneficial for maximally exposing active edge sites. The hybrid P-PC60@MoS2 with proper synthetic engineering possesses superior catalytic kinetics with surpassing overpotential of 59 mV, Tafel slope of 37 mV dec(-1), which are much lower than those of pure MoS2 and P-PC60. The small values indicate fast electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics. (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Polyoxometalate-Derived Hexagonal Molybdenum Nitrides (MXenes) Supported by Boron, Nitrogen Codoped Carbon Nanotubes for Efficient Electrochemical Hydrogen Evolution from Seawater
T2  - ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - MXenes and doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have entered into research arenas for high-rate energy storage and conversion. Herein, a method of postsynthesis of MXenes in boron, nitrogen codoped CNTs (BNCNTs) is reported with their electrocatalytical hydrogen evolution performance. The encapsulation of hexagonal molybdenum nitrate nanoparticles (h-MoN NPs) into BNCNTs protects h-MoN NPs from agglomeration and poisoning in the complex environment. In principle, the synergism of B and N dopants on the doped CNTs and confined h-MoN NPs produces extremely active sites for electrochemical hydrogen evolution. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the active sites for hydrogen evolution originate from the synergistic effect of h-MoN(001)/CN (graphitic N doping) and h-MoN(001)/BNC. The h-MoN@BNCNT electrocatalyst exhibits a small overpotential of 78 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 46 mV per decade, which are dramatically improved over all reported MoN-based materials and doped CNTs. Additionally, it also exhibits outstanding electrochemical stability in environments with various pH values and seawater media from South China Sea.

AB  - Biohydrogen production through Microbial Electrolysis Cell (MEC) has drifted towards the development of suitable cost-effective cathode catalysts. In this study, two graphene hybrid metal oxide nanocomposites were used as catalysts to investigate hydrogen production in the MEC operated with sugar industry wastewater as substrate against phosphate buffer catholyte. Electrochemical characterizations exposed the better performance of NiO(center dot)rGO coated cathode which showed lesser overpotential at 600 mV and overall lowest resistance in the Nyquist plots than Ni-foam and Co(3)O(4 center dot)rGO cathodes. The experimental results showed that at an applied voltage 1.0 V, NiO(center dot)rGO nanocomposite had exhibited maximum hydrogen production rate of 4.38 +/- 0.11 mmol/L/D, Coloumbic efficiency of 65.6% and Cathodic hydrogen recovery of 20.8% respectively. The MEC performance in terms of biohydrogen production was 1.19 and 2.68 times higher than Co(3)O(4 center dot)rGO and uncoated Ni-Foam. Hence, economical hybrid nanocomposite catalysts were demonstrated in MEC using industrial effluent for energy and environment sustainability. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Effects of GO addition, trans-membrane pressure and membrane thickness on the gas separation performance of membrane were evaluated as a function of permeability and CO2/H-2 selectivity. GO addition increased the CO2/H-2 selectivity and H-2 purification performance. The highest CO2 permeability of 3670 Barrer and CO2/H-2 selectivity of 11.7 were obtained when the GO loading was 0.5 wt% when the trans membrane pressure was 0.2 Mpa.

AB  - Herein, a highly efficient and stable palladium nickel nanoparticles (Pd-Ni NPs) supported on graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized, characterized and applied for the dehydrogenation of dimethyl ammonia borane (DMAB). The monodisperse Pd-Ni NPs has been synthesized via the ultrasonic double solvent reduction method in the presence of oleylamine and GO as support matrices. The structure morphology and properties of Pd-Ni@GO NPs were characterized by using different techniques such as UV-VIS, XPS, TEM, HRTEM and XRD methods. The Pd-Ni@GO NPs was found to be highly effective and stable in the dehydrogenation of DMAB. This catalyst with the turnover frequency of 271.9 h(-1) shows one of the best results among the all prepared catalysts in literature for the dehydrogenation of DMAB. The apparent activation parameters of the catalytic dehydrogenation reaction were also calculated; apparent activation energy (E-a,E-app) = 38 +/- 2 kJ mol(-1), activation enthalpy (Delta H-#,(app)) = 35 +/- 1 kJ mol(-1) and activation entropy (Delta S-#,(app)) = -102 +/- 1 J K-1 mol(-1).

AB  - Herein, we developed a facile one-pot aqueous method to fabricate well-distributed bimetallic AuPd nanoclusters supported on graphitic carbon nitride (AuPd NCs/g-C3N4). The method is simple, rapid, without using any specific additives. The nanocomposites displayed enlarged electrochemically active surface area. The obtained nanocatalyst exhibited the more positive onset and half-wave potentials at 1.09 and 0.98 V (vs. NHE) for oxygen reduction reaction, respectively, along with the enhanced kinetic current density of 1.86 mA cm(-2). Meanwhile, the catalyst showed the improved catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction with the onset potential of -29 mV (vs. NHE) and small Tafel slope of 47 mV dec(-1). These results demonstrated the improved electrocatalytic performance of the catalyst in contrast with commercial Pt/C (50%) and Pd/C (20%) catalysts. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB  - Highly effective and stable palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) supported on graphene oxide (GO) were synthesized, characterized and applied for dehydrogenation of dimethylamine-borane (DMAB). Monodisperse Pd NPs were synthesized with the ultrasonic reduction method in the presence of oleylamine and GO as support matrices at room temperature. Almost uniformly distributed Pd (0) nanoparticles in size of 3.89 nm were isolated in a reproducible manner by filtering through the reaction mixture. They were characterized by TEM, HRTEM, XRD, Raman, and XPS. It was found that Pd@GO NPs are stable and one of the most active catalysts in the dehydrogenation of DMAB. This catalyst with its turnover frequency of 38.02 h(-1) exhibits one of the good results among all the catalysts prepared in the literature for dehydrogeneration of DMAB. Significant activation parameters of the catalytic dehydrogenation reaction were also calculated, and the activation enthalpy (Delta H-#), activation entropy (Delta S-#) and the apparent activation energy (Ea) were found 16.5 kJ mol(-1), -179 J mol(-1) K-1, and 18.6 kJ mol(-1), respectively.

TI  - Prediction of proton conductivity of graphene oxide-containing polymeric membranes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present work we examined the capability of a simple Nernst-Planck based model to predict the proton conductivity of polymeric membranes which contained pristine or functionalized graphene oxide sheets (GO or F-GO, respectively). A wide comparison with experimental data on both fluorinated and non-fluorinated membranes has been made. It was found that the expression employed for calculating the tortuosity factor of the model played an important role in whether the experimental data was accurately predicted. A modification of the tortuosity factor expression was proposed to enable the model to provide the best agreement between the experimental and theoretical values of proton conductivity. The results showed that in the case of fluorinated membranes at low amounts of GO or at high test temperatures the modified model was able to represent the experimental data more accurately than the original model. However, the selection of the best expression for the tortuosity factor calculations in non-fluorinated membrane systems depended on the ion exchange capacity values of the host membranes.

AB  - For the first time, a novel technique of preparing Zn2GeO4 nanostructures has been developed by using chemical precipitation method of GeCl4 as a Ge precursor and acacen as a capping agent. Uniform and fine Zn2GeO4 nanoparticle was synthesized. The optimized Zn2GeO4 nanostructures anchored onto graphene sheets and Zn2GeO4/graphene nano composite synthesized through pre-graphenization, successfully. Hydrogen storage capacities of Zn2GeO4 nanoparticle and Zn2GeO4/graphene nanocomposite were compared, for the first time. Obtained results represent that Zn2GeO4/graphene nanocomposites have higher electrochemical hydrogen storage capacity than Zn2GeO4 nanoparticles. It was found that the synergistic effect between Zn2GeO4 nanoparticles and graphene sheets can improve the electrochemical performance of this hybrid composite electrode. After 29 cycles, the discharging capacities of the electrode reached to 2695 mAh/g. These results indicate that the Zn2GeO4/graphene nanocomposite can be potentially applied for electrochemical hydrogen storage. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Development of high-performance catalyst materials with superior activity is among the high challenges in hydrogen production. In this study, the platinum nanoparticles@graphene oxide@nickel-copper@nickel foam (Pt@GO@Ni-Cu@NF) electrode was fabricated using the electrodeposition method. The synthesized electrode demonstrated a high electrocatalytic activity and superior stability in alkaline solution. The required over-potentials for delivering 10, 20, and 100 mA cm(-2) were 31, 50, and 128 mV vs. RHE, respectively. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) mechanism, affording to the Tafel slope (51 mV dec(-1)), was Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. The electrode was stable at 100 mA cm(-2) after 50 h. The high stability and electrocatalytic activity for HER of the Pt@GO@Ni-Cu@NF electrode were assigned to the dendrite Ni-Cu structure and the high electrochemical surface area of the GO nanolayers (2600), as well as its hydrophilic properties, intrinsic properties of the Pt nanoparticles with a dimension of 20-40 nm, and lower H-2 bubble size. Because of the excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability, this study introduces an effective electrode material for the large-scale hydrogen production industry.

TI  - Sulfonated graphene oxide/Nafion composite membranes for high-performance direct methanol fuel cells
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - An easy and effective method for producing low methanol-crossover membranes is developed by dispersing sulfonated graphene oxide (SGO) into a Nafion matrix. A SGO/Nafion mixture with low SGO content exhibits unique viscosity behavior and allows for better SGO dispersion within the Nafion. After film casting, the composite membranes show lower methanol and water uptakes, a reduced swelling ratio, improved proton conductivity in low relative humidity, and extremely high methanol selectivity, which can be implemented in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). The regular backbone of the composite membrane shows a higher storage modulus, increased a-relaxation (transition temperature), and improved tolerance to pressure during membrane electrode assembly (MEA). The small angle X-ray spectra indicate the shrinkage of the ionic clusters in the composite membranes, which thus reduce methanol crossover. The hybrid membranes applied to DMFCs demonstrate performances superior to that of the commercial Nafion 115 in 1 M and 5 M methanol solutions. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

TI  - CeO2 nanowires stretch-embedded in reduced graphite oxide nanocornposite support for Pt nanoparticles as potential electrocatalyst for methanol oxidation reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel hybrid composite RGO-CeO2 Nws with the nanowire-sheet structure was synthesized by a facile hydrothermal process using ethanol/water as the solvent without any organic additives. The graphene oxide proceeds to reduce to graphene and chemical bonds form between graphene oxide and CeO2 NWS. Pt-based catalysts with the RGO-CeO2 NWS composite as the support were then prepared by a microwave-assisted polyol process. The resultant catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, Scanning tunneling microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, High resolution transmission electron microscopy and electrochemical tests. The results show that the hybrid Pt/RGO(4)-CeO2 Nws exhibits the best catalytic activity and the increased catalytic efficiency of Pt in the hybrid catalysts is evidence that CeO2 NWS are anchored onto the chemical defects in the wrinkles and edges of the graphene surface. This avoids the restacking of graphene oxide, thus hindering the Pt nanoparticles embedded in folding and increasing the exposed active sites. The changed valence state from Ce4+ to Ce3+ in CeO2 Nws will introduce oxygen vacancies and thus promote the tolerance of intermediate species in methanol oxidation.

TI  - Magnetic graphene oxide-ionic liquid grafted chitosan composites anchored Pd(0) nanoparticles: A robust heterogeneous catalyst with enhanced activity and superior reusability for hydrogen generation from ammonia borane
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Magnetic solid materials may be separated easily from the solution by an external magnetic field and gain abundant applying opportunities. In this paper, magnetic composites are fabricated from ionic liquid grafted chitosan, graphene oxide, ferrous chloride and ferric chloride via a one-pot self-assembly combined with co-precipitation method. Then, the GO-ILCS-Fe3O4 composites are used as supports to anchor the in-situ reduced palladium nanoparticles (Pd(0) NPs). The results show that the Pd(0) NPs with a particle size distribution of 1.8-2.4 nm are dispersed well on GO-ILCS-Fe3O4 in the Pd(0)/GO-ILCS-Fe3O4 catalysts, which exhibit enhanced catalytic activity and superior reusability in the hydrogen generation from NH3BH3 (AB). The corresponding turnover frequency reaches up to 30.2 mol(H2).mol(pd)(-1).min(-1) and the reaction activation energy is as low as 32.6 kJ mol(-1). Moreover, the effects of catalyst dosage and AB concentration on the catalytic efficiency are also investigated. The results confirm that the palladium-based magnetic catalysts will be useful for the development of hydrogen generation. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Ionothermal synthesis of N-doped carbon supported CoMn2O4 nanoparticles as ORR catalyst in direct glucose alkaline fuel cell
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, CoMn2O4/NC nanocomposites were synthesized via a facile ionothermal synthesis route, and their electrocatalytic performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was investigated in a direct glucose alkaline fuel cell (DGAFC). The CoMn2O4 spinel sup-ported on nitrogen-doped carbon was successfully synthesized with the assistance of the ionic liquid [C(6)mim]Cl. The nanocomposite exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity towards ORR. Especially, CoMn2O4/NC achieved a half wave potential of 0.81 V (vs RHE) and a maximum diffusion limiting current density of 5.2 mA cm(-2), that are very close to commercial Pt/C catalyst (E-1/2 = 0.83 V vs RHE, J(d) = 5.0 mA cm(-2)). In addition, the catalytic performance of CoMn2O4/NC was investigated in DGFC. The fuel cell with a CoMn2O4/NC air cathode achieved a peak power density of 23.72 W m(-2), which was even superior to that with a commercial Pt/C air cathode. This work revealed that ionic liquid is a viable reaction medium for preparation of catalyst with robust activity. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Fabrication of highly dispersed palladium/graphene oxide nanocomposites and their catalytic properties for efficient hydrogenation of p-nitrophenol and hydrogen generation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this report, graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets decorated with ultrafine Pd nanoparticles (Pd.NPs) have been successfully fabricated through a reaction between [Pd-2(mu-CO)(2)Cl-4](2-) and water in the presence of GO nanosheets without any surfactant or other reductant. The as-synthesized small Pd NPs with average diameter of about 4.4 nm were well-dispersed on the surface of GO nanosheets. The Pd/GO nanocomposites show remarkable catalytic activity toward the hydrogenation of p-nitrophenol at room temperature. The kinetic apparent rate constant (k(app)) could reach about 34.3 x 10(-3) s(-1). Furthermore, the as-prepared Pd/GO nanocomposites could also be used as an efficient and stable catalyst for hydrogen production from hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane (AB). The catalytic activity is much higher than the conventional Pd/C catalysts. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Pd-Ni-Fe nanoparticles supported on MnO2/Vulcan XC-72 R (carbon black powder) as the electrocatalyst for the anodic oxidation of ethanol in a direct ethanol alkaline fuel cell (DEAFC) has been conducted. Electrocatalyst structures and morphologies are investigated by XRD, FE-SEM, EDX and elemental mapping techniques and subsequently electro-chemical performance of electrocatalysts for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) are studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry (CA) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Pd/MnO2/Vulcan, Pd-Ni/MnO2/Vulcan and Pd-Ni-Fe/MnO2/Vulcan efficiently advanced ethanol electro-oxidation reaction under alkaline conditions. Pd/MnO2/Vulcan revealed best potential window and low charge transfer resistance (R-ct) for EOR. Pd-Ni/MnO2/Vulcan and Pd-Ni-Fe/MnO2/Vulcan electrocatalysts have a good anti CO-poisoning capability. Pd-Ni-Fe/MnO2/Vulcan has significantly high current density, excellent catalyst durability and cyclic stability for ethanol oxidation which encourage researchers for application of such exceptional materials as anode electrocatalysts in DEFC.

TI  - Triphenylamine-functionalized graphene decorated with Pt nanoparticles and its application in photocatalytic hydrogen production
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A new type of graphene-based nanohybrid was prepared from graphene nanosheets and 4-(diphenylamino)benzaldehyde (TPA-CHO) through 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. The nanohybrid was modified by platinum nanoparticles via photodeposition. The nanohybrid and its Pt modified nanocomposite were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Ultraviolet-visible absorption (UV-vis), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and Raman spectra confirmed that triphenylamine moiety grafted on the graphene surface. The results of fluorescence quenching and photocurrent enhancement of the triphenylamine-functionalized graphene revealed that photoinduced electron transfer from triphenylamine moiety to the graphene sheet. The investigation of using the Pt modified graphene-based nanocomposite as a photocatalyst for H-2 evolution showed that under UV-vis light irradiation, the average H-2 evolution rate and the quantum efficiency is 2.3 mu mol h(-1) and 0.45% mol E-1 respectively. This work demonstrated a potential application of an organic sensitizer covalently functionalized graphene as a novel photocatalyst in the field of solar energy conversion.

TI  - Investigation of surface interaction in rGO-CdS photocatalyst for hydrogen production: An insight from XPS studies
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Formation of heterojunction in supported-photocatalyst plays an important role in pho-tocatalysis for hydrogen production. However, study of this formation is needed to be more. Reduced graphene supported-cum-doped Cadmium sulphide (rGO-CdS) is widely employed for the production of hydrogen by photocatalysis splitting of water. The Formation of surface interaction between rGO and CdS was explained by detailed analysis by using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy with depth profiling, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The charge transfer phenomena through heterojunction are also explicated. The higher conductivity of rGO further facilitated the transmission of electrons to the interface of solid-liquid. Thus, the restric-tion of charge recombination and greater mobility of electron yielded superior activity to the CdS/rGO catalyst which was prepared by impregnation method followed by the H2S gas reaction with high temperature.

TI  - Microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthesis of graphene based Au-TiO2 photocatalysts for efficient visible-light hydrogen production
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
M3  - Article
AB  - The construction and application of visible-light-driven photocataLysts falls in the central focus for the efficient utilization of renewable solar energy, which provides unprecedented opportunities for addressing the increasing concerns on energy and environmental sustainability. Herein, graphene based Au-TiO2 photocataLysts were fabricated by a simple, one-step microwave-assisted hydrothermal method, using Degussa P25 TiO2 powder (P25), graphene oxide and HAuCl4 aqueous solution as the raw materials. The effects of graphene introduction and gold Loading on the photocatalytic hydrogen production rates of the as-prepared samples in a methanolic aqueous solution were investigated. The results indicated that Au-TiO2-graphene composite had a significanty increased visible Light absorption and enhanced photocatalytic H-2-production activity compared to the Au-TiO2 composite. In comparison, the pure TiO2, graphene-TiO2 and graphene-Au had no appreciable visible-light-driven H-2 production. The enhanced photocatalytic H-2-production activity of the Au-TiO2-graphene composite is ascribed to (1) the Load of the Au nanoparticles which broadens the visible Light response of TiO2 due to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect, and (2) the introduction of graphene, which functions as rapid electron transfer units, facilitating the space separation of photoelectron and hole pairs. The proposed H-2-production activity enhancement mechanism was further confirmed by the transient photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments.

TI  - In-situ synthesis of palladium-base binary metal oxide nanoparticles with enhanced electrocatalytic activity for ethylene glycol and glycerol oxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To achieve the better electrocatalytic activity and stability of Pd-base catalysts for ethylene glycol and glycerol oxidation reactions, a novel Pd-base binary Pd Co oxides nanoparticles (Pd PdO-CoOx) was synthesized by in-situ oxidation of Pd Co precursor. The strategy was simple, mild, green and efficient. The prepared nanoparticles exhibited a mutually connected, fused irregular nanoparticles in TEM. The as-synthesized Pd PdO-CoOx (1:4) nanoparticles displayed prominent catalytic activity (5.82 A mg,1 for ethylene glycol and 5.16 A mg forfor glycerol) for ethylene glycol and glycerol oxidation reactions in alkaline solution compared to the commercial Pt/C (1.64 A mgp(-1) for ethylene glycol and 1.48 A mg,T, for glycerol) catalyst. The improved electrocatalytic activity of Pd PdO-CoOx catalyst mainly ascribes to the producing Strong Metal-Support Interactions (SMSI) between PdO-CoOx and Pd nanoparticles, the synergistic effect between PdO and CoOx and the presence of CoO promoved hydroxyl adsorption at lower potentials. Combined with the simple synthetic method, lower cost and good performance, Pd PdO-CoOx is a promising catalyst for direct fuel cells. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Graphene reduction of P25 titania: Ti3+- doped titania/graphene nanohybrids for enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ti3+-doped titania has attracted great attention in recent years by its enhanced photocatalytic performance as compared to the conventional titania systems. In this work, solvothermally reduced hydroxy graphene (RHG), derived from fluorographite (FGT), is used to reduce commercially available P25 titania to produce Ti3+-doped, TiO2-x/RHG nanocomposites, via a facile solid-state route. These nanohybrids exhibit high performance towards photocatalytic hydrogen generation under broad-band irradiation, with a 3497 mu mol/g/h hydrogen production rate, without the assistance of any noble metal co-catalyst. This enhanced rate can be attributed to the surface defects generated by Ti3+-doping as well as the ability of RHG to perform as a highly efficient scavenger for the photogenerated electrons. It is hypothesized that RHG could serve as one of the most suitable co-catalysts for the semiconductor-based photocatalysts. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this work, we report an improved catalyst which is superior to known heterogeneous catalysts for dehydrocoupling Of dimethylamine-borane (DMAB). The prepared three metallic nanocomposites consist of graphene oxide supported monodisperse palladium, ruthenium and nickel nanomaterials (3.78 +/- 0.43 nm). The monodisperse PdRuNi nano particles decorated with graphene oxide (PdRuNi@GO) were synthesized according to the microwave synthesis method and characterized by TEM (Transmisson Electron Microscopy), HR-TEM (High Resolution Transmisson Electron Microscopy), XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy), XRD (X-ray diffraction) and Raman spectroscopy. The prepared trimetallic nanocomposites have shown outstanding performance and stability as a catalyst for the dehydrocoupling of dimethylamine-borane. To the best of our knowledge, the prepared monodisperse PdRuNi@GO nanoparticles have one of the best catalysts with outstanding TOF (Turnover Frequency) value (737.05 1/h) and E-a (55.47 kJ/mol) (activation energy) among all catalysts prepared for dehydrogenation of dimethylamine-borane at low temperatures.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sulfonated organosilane functionalized graphene oxides (SSi-GO) synthesized through the grafting of graphene oxide (GO) with 3-mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane and subsequent oxidation have been used as a filler in sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) membranes. The incorporation of SSi-GOs greatly increases the ion-exchange capacity (IEC), water uptake, and proton conductivity of the membrane. With well-controlled contents of SSi-GOs, the composite membranes exhibit higher proton conductivity and lower methanol permeability than Nafion (R) 112 and Nafion (R) 115, making them particularly attractive as proton exchange membranes (PEMs) for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC). The composite membrane with optimal SSi-GOs content exhibit over 38 and 17% higher power densities, respectively, than Nafion (R) 112 and Nafion (R) 115 membranes in DMFCs, offering the possibilities to reduce the DMFC membrane cost significantly while keeping high-performance.

TI  - Light-driven proton reduction with in situ supported copper nanoparticles
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Heterogeneous copper particles have been widely investigated in photocatalytic reduction processes to produce hydrogen. In this contribution, copper nanoparticles were in situ generated and supported on different C- and SiO2-based additives in the presence of an iridium photosensitizer (PS), which itself was activated by visible light absorption. Thereby, the influence of the supports on the formation of the active species and their performance as water reduction catalysts were studied. The additives ensure heterogeneous nucleation leading to lower sizes of the formed copper particles and prevent their further growth during the reaction which was verified by STEM analysis. Consequently, the hydrogen productivity in the presence of the supports was enhanced and the best carbon material rGO(H-2) revealed a 3 times higher activity compared to the non-supported system after 20 h. Photoluminescence measurements confirmed the proposed reductive quenching mechanism in this system and suggested that rGO(H-2) mediates reoxidation of the PS. However, in the presence of the ligand 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy) the application of the silica MCM-41 showed a fourfold increase of hydrogen evolution compared to the non-supported system, which was still active after 160 h and could be successfully reused in recycling experiments.

AB  - Glucose is one of derivative products from agriculture, possessing high theoretical energy density, non-toxicity and ease of storage, which has been of interest as a fuel in glucose fuel cell. In this work, quaternized polybenzimidazole (Q-PBI) and quaternized graphene oxide (Q-GO) were successfully functionalized by the quaternization between polybenzimidazole (PBI) and 3-bromopropyl trimethylammonium bromide (3-Br), and the reaction between graphene oxide (GO) and dimethyloctadecyl [3(Trimethoxysilyl) propyl] ammonium chloride (DMAOP), respectively. The Q-GOs with various volume fractions were embedded as the dispersed phase in the Q-PBI matrix to produce the Q-GO/Q-PBI composites as an AEM. The 0.5%v/vQ-GO/Q-PBI composite AEM showed the highest hydroxide conductivity of 1.12 +/- 0.01 mS cm(-1) at 27 degrees C, the ion exchange capacity of 1.70 +/- 0.03 mmol.g(-1), the water uptake of 66.61 +/- 0.57%, and the glucose permeability of (1.79 +/- 0.83) x 10(-8) cm(2) - s(-1). The hydroxide conductivity was higher than the commercial Fumasep (R) FAB-PK-130 by a factor of 23 times, whereas the glucose permeability was lower by at least an order of magnitude.

TI  - A green and facile synthesis of TiO2/graphene nanocomposites and their photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This work reports a green and facile approach to synthesize chemically bonded TiO2/graphene sheets (GS) nanocomposites using a one-step hydrothermal method. The as-prepared composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and ultraviolet visible (UV-Vis) diffuse reflectance spectra. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated by hydrogen evolution from water splitting under UV Vis light illumination. An enhancement of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution was observed over the TiO2/GS composite photocatalysts, as 1.6 times larger for TiO2/2.0 wt%GS than that of Degussa P25. This fabrication process features the reduction of graphene oxide and formation of TiO2 simultaneously leading to the well dispersion of generated TiO2 nanoparticles on the surface of GS.

TI  - Development of graphene supported platinum nanoparticles for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells: Effect of support type and impregnation-reduction methods
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - There are various studies for the development of graphene supported platinum (Pt/graphene) as the electrocatalyst for polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells, however, a few of them confirmed the fuel cell performance. We demonstrate here a comprehensive overview on synthesis, characterization and fuel cell performance of Pt/graphene electrocatalysts. In our study, Pt nanoparticles were anchored onto graphene oxide (GO), graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) and thermally reduced GO (TRGO) by several impregnation reduction methods including ethylene glycol reflux, sodium borohydride reduction and ascorbic acid reduction. The most promising results in terms of Pt dispersion, particle size, and electrocatalytic activity were obtained with ethylene glycol reflux and GO as the support material. The maximum power density of 320 mW cm(-2) (40% higher than that of Pt/Vulcan XC-72) was achieved for Pt/r-GO with a Pt loading of 0.25 mg cm(-2). Moreover, PEM fuel cell performance of Pt/GNP is presented for the first time in literature. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Highly active and durable Pd nanoparticles-porous graphitic carbon nitride composite for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a cathodic process of fuel cells. The carbon supported Platinum, Pt/C catalyst is universally used as cathode materials; but poor durability of Pt/C due to degradation of catalyst prevent its wide spread applications. It is thus important to develop new cathode material(s) with high activity and stability. We report here, superior electrocatalytic activity of palladium nanoparticles-carbon nitride (Pd-CNx) composite towards ORR in both alkaline and acidic media. The ORR activity on Pd-CNx catalyst is better (half wave potential E-1/2 of 60 mV more positive) than that of Pt/C in 0.5 M KOH solution and is almost comparable in acid media. Moreover, this porous composite display excellent methanol tolerance and has much better long term durability than that of commercial Pt/C in both acidic and alkaline media. Only 4 and 6 mV positive shift of E-1/2 after 1500 potential cycles in basic medium and acid media respectively prove the excellent durability of this catalyst. The superior electrocatalytic activity and excellent stability of porous Pd-CN. composite can be attributed to unique synergistic interaction between CNx support and Pd nanoparticles (Pd-NPs), lower the d-band center of Pd, easy mass transport, and surface structure of Pd-NPs.

TI  - Carbon supported PtPdCr ternary alloy nanoparticles with enhanced electrocatalytic activity and durability for methanol oxidation reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, the trimetallic PtPdCr nanoparticles with low platinum loading (similar to 5 wt%) supported on Vulcan carbon (PtPdCr/C) were synthesized through a facile two-step coreduction method and showed superior methanol oxidation activity. The particle size distribution, morphology and elemental composition of the PtPdCr/C were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The electrochemical performance for methanol oxidation of the PtPdCr/C was found to be higher with the mass activity of 969 mA.mg(Pt)(-1) compared to Pt/C (581 mA.mg(-1) (Pt)) and PtRu/C (725 mA.mg(Pt)(-1)). Moreover, the stability studies confirmed the enhanced durability of PtPdCr/C over Pt/C and PtRu/C catalysts after the accelerated durability test (ADT) and chronoamperometry (CA) analysis. The increased methanol oxidation activity and durability of the trimetallic PtPdCr/C in acid medium can be attributed to the change in binding energy of Pt and the induced synergistic effect from Pd and Cr atoms to Pt, which demonstrated a promising strategy for the preparation and utilization of ternary alloy catalysts towards methanol electrooxidation.

TI  - N, P-codoped molybdenum carbide nanoparticles loaded into N, P-codoped graphene for the enhanced electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the ever-growing interest of heteroatoms (e.g., P, N, S, transition metals) doping into molybdenum carbide and graphene for electrochemical reactions, herein, a ternary phosphomolybdic acid-polyethyleneimine/graphene oxide nanocomposite as a suitable precursor was developed to not only uniformly hybridize molybdenum and carbon source to perform the controllable in situ growth of well-defined molybdenum carbide nanostructure on graphene by annealing, but also synchronously dope N and P atoms into molybdenum carbide crystal lattice and graphene. The as-prepared hybrid showed remarkable electrocatalytic activity and high stability for hydrogen evolution reaction in basic media, due to the following favorable features, i.e. a large accessible active sites afforded by the ultrafine molybdenum carbide, the heteroatoms doped, the regulated electronic structure, the balanced thermodynamics between hydrogen adsorption and desorption, the accelerated charge/mass transfer ability by the ultrathin and defective carbon layer, and the protection of molybdenum carbide by carbon layer. As a result, it only needed a small overpotential of 47 mV to drive 10 mA cm(-2) and a low onset potential of 10 mV, as well as a small Tafel slope of 56.8 mV center dot dec(-1), thus suggesting its promising potential for hydrogen evolution electrocatalyst.

TI  - Pt coated Co nanoparticles supported on N-doped mesoporous carbon as highly efficient, magnetically recyclable and reusable catalyst for hydrogen generation from ammonia borane
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ammonia borane (NH3BH3, AB) is considered as an excellent chemical material for the hydrogen storage attribute to its high hydrogen storage capacity. However, developing highly efficient catalysts for continuous hydrogen generation from AB is still a challenge for the future fuel cell applications. Initially, a facile one-pot carbonization method was used for fabrication cobalt nanoparticles (Co NPs) doped fluffy N-doped mesoporous carbon (Co/mCN). Further, the Pt@Co/mCN nanocatalyst was prepared through a facile spontaneous displacement reaction by using the Co/mCN material and H2PtCl6 as the starting materials. Here, the metallic Pt only covered on the surface of the Co NPs in the view of Pt saving. The Pt@Co/mCN nanocatalyst was used in the catalytic hydrogen generation from AB and showed excellent catalytic activity and reusability. The superior catalytic activity of the Pt@Co/mCN nanocatalyst is probably due to the isolated Pt atoms on the surface of the Co NPs and the highly dispersed Pt@Co NPs on the surface of the fluffy mCN support.

TI  - ZIF-derived graphene coated/Co9S8 nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen doped porous carbon polyhedrons as advanced catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Development of efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is vitally important for the commercialization of metal-air batteries. In this work, we demonstrate a novel graphene coated/Co9S8 nanoparticles-embedded nitrogen doped porous carbon dodecahedron hybrid (Co9S8/NPCP@rGO) prepared by the pyrolysis and sulphuration of precursors composing of graphene oxide and zeolitic imidazolate-frameworks (ZIP). The Co9S8/NPCP@rGO hybrid is used as a highly efficient nonprecious metal electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction and exhibits more positive onset potential and half-wave potential, higher limiting current density, lower Tafel slope, and better durability and methanol tolerance in alkaline media in comparison to the commercial 20 wt.% Pt/C catalyst. The greatly improved electrocatalytic performance of Co9S8/NPCP@rGO can be attributed to the unique structure with Co9S8 nanoparticles dispersed uniformly inside nitrogen doped porous carbon matrix, and the synergistic effect between Co9S8/NPCP polyhedral hybrid and rGO.

TI  - Graphene oxide: A promising nanomaterial for energy and environmental applications
T2  - NANO ENERGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Graphene oxide (GO), the functionalized graphene with oxygen-containing chemical groups, has recently attracted resurgent interests because of its superior properties such as large surface area, mechanical stability, tunable electrical and optical properties. Moreover, the surface functional groups of hydroxyl, epoxy and carboxyl make GO an excellent candidate in coordinating with other materials or molecules. Owing to the expanded structural diversity and improved overall properties, GO and its composites hold great promise for versatile applications of energy storage/conversion and environment protection, including hydrogen storage materials, photocatalyst for water splitting, removal of air pollutants and water purification, as well as electrode materials for various lithium batteries and supercapacitors. In this review, we present an overview on the current successes, as well as the challenges, of the GO-based materials for energy and environmental applications. (C) 2015 The Authors.

TI  - Fe3+-Clinoptilolite/graphene oxide and layered MoS2@Nitrogen doped graphene as novel graphene based nanocomposites for DMFC
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fe3+ doped in a natural zeolite (Fe3+-Clinoptilolite) hybridized with graphene oxide (GO) was used as an electro-catalyst for methanol oxidation in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC). Furthermore, thin layered molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) composited with nitrogen doped graphene (NG) was used for oxygen reduction. Successful synthesis of these nano materials was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray florescence (XRF), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX), Raman spectroscopy, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. In the following, by using the cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique the electrochemical behaviors of the glassy carbon electrodes modified with the mentioned composites were investigated. The results of methanol oxidation and oxygen reduction showed sufficient electro-catalytic effects as well as significant diffusion currents in presence of the non-precious synthetic materials. Obtained exchange currents (i(0)) from Tafel plots showed increasment up to 6.02 x 10(-6) and 1.47 x 10(-5) A for anode and cathode respectively. Also, thermodynamic potential of the DMFC was estimated about 1.1 V in alkaline media that was very close to reported value for theoretical potential in DMFC.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The design and development of an economic and highly active non-precious electrocatalyst for ethanol electro-oxidation is challenging due to expensiveness of the precursors as well as processes and non-Eco friendliness. In this study, a novel preparation of mesoporous NiCo2O4-MWCNT nanocomposite aerogels based on sol gel technique is proposed. Multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT)-supported NiCo2O4 nanocomposite aerogels as an efficient catalyst for the ethanol electro-oxidation is reported. The MWCNTs exhibit an interconnected fibrous network with uniform dispersion of NiCo2O4 nanoparticles. The effects of MWCNT concentration on the ethanol electro-oxidation of MWCNT/NiCo2O4 aerogels are studied. We found that using a proper loading of MWCNTs allowed us to reach higher current densities for the oxidation of ethanol in an alkaline media. The highly porous and fibrous MWCNT/NiCo2O4 aerogels are the promising electro-catalysts for the oxidation of a direct ethanol fuel cell. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Enhanced photosensitization of zinc oxide nanorods using polyaniline for efficient photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical water splitting
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Polyaniline (PANI) coupled Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanocomposite has been synthesized by the chemisorption method and demonstrated its potential applications for photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue dye and photoelectrochemical (PEG) water splitting. A similar to 7 fold enhancement in the photodegradation activity and similar to 3 fold enhancement in the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency is observed for PANI/ZnO nanocomposite as compared to bare ZnO nanorods. The observed enhancement in the photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical activity is attributed to the photosensitization effect of visible light responsive PANI and the formation of type-II heterojunction between ZnO and PANI leading to the efficient separation and faster transfer of photoinduced charge carriers at the interface. A possible mechanism for the enhanced photocatalytic activity and photo-electrochemical water splitting for PANI/ZnO nanocomposite has been proposed.

AB  - A series of Z scheme systems are constructed in three ways and the photocatalytic H-2 evolution activities are evaluated under visible light irradiation. The Z scheme system can be constructed by loading ZnIn2S4 onto BiVO4. The H-2 evolution is successfully realized under the visible light without providing a sacrificial agent, and the activity is greatly improved when the graphene is acted as a solid electron mediator. The best Z scheme system of 1.0La-ZnIn2S4/1.5RGO/1.0RuO(2)/BiVO4 (1:5) is obtained. Its photocatalytic H-2 evolution activity and the A.Q.Y. reach 4.1 mu mol g(-1) h and 0.8%, respectively. Furthermore, its property is characterized by various analysis techniques, such as XRD, Raman, SEM, BET and PL, and the catalytic mechanism is also discussed.

TI  - The synergistic effect of metallic molybdenum dioxide nanoparticle decorated graphene as an active electrocatalyst for an enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
M3  - Article
AB  - As a durable and renewable fuel, hydrogen has attracted a huge amount of global interest in its production via different routes. Among these methods, the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is one of the most promising ways for low-cost hydrogen production in the future. In this work, a simple redox hydrothermal method has been developed to fabricate a noble-metal-free MoO2/rGO composite for a highly efficient HER. GO nanosheets provide oxygen-containing functional groups for precursor attachment, and restrict growth of MoO2 nanoparticles (NPs) with a small size due to the space confinement effect among GO layers as well. Benefitting from a synergistic effect between metallic MoO2 NPs and graphene, the obtained MoO2/rGO composite exhibits excellent HER activity with a small onset overpotential of 190 mV, a large cathodic current density, and a small Tafel slope of 49 mV per decade, while MoO2 NPs or rGO itself is not a very efficient HER catalyst. Additionally, the MoO2/rGO composite displays good stability after 1000 potential cycles under both acidic and alkaline conditions. Dramatically improved HER activity and excellent stability are attributed to small size, more active sites, high conductivity and a synergistic effect of MoO2 NPs and graphene. The development of the MoO2/rGO composite as an enhanced active HER catalyst broadens the members of Mo-based HER catalysts and provides an insight into the design and synthesis of other noble-metal-free materials for the cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalyst in electrochemical hydrogen production.

TI  - Development of polybenzimidazole/graphene oxide composite membranes for high temperature PEM fuel cells
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, phosphoric acid doped Polybenzimidazole/Graphene Oxide (PBI/GO) nano composite membranes were prepared by dispersion of various amounts of GO in PBI polymer matrix followed by phosphoric acid doping for high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (HT-PEMFC) application. The structure of the PBI/GO composite membranes was investigated by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The introduction of GO into the FBI polymer matrix helps to improve the acid doping, proton conductivity and acid leaching properties. The SEM analyses have proved the uniform and homogeneous distribution of GO in composite membranes. The composite membranes were tested in a single HT-PEMFC with a 5 cm(2) active area at 165 degrees C without humidification. HT-PEMFC tests show that PBI/ GO composite membrane with 2 wt. % GO content performed better than bare PBI membrane at non humidified condition. At ambient pressure and 165 degrees C, the maximum power density of the PBI/GO-1 membrane can reach 0.38 W/cm(2), and the current density at 0.6 V is up to 0.252 A/cm(2), with H-2/air. The results indicate the PBI/GO composite membranes could be utilized as the proton exchange membranes for HT-PEMFC. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Platinum nanoparticles anchored on aminated silica@PEDOT-PSS hybrid for enhanced methanol oxidation electrocatalysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) with near-zero pollution emission, large energy density, and low operating temperature provides a beneficial and sustainable way for alleviating fossil energy crisis and ecological pollution issues. In this work, a systematic protocol was explored for the design of novel electrocatalyst based on PEDOT-PSS coated amino-functionalized SiO2 microspheres (SiO2-NH2@PEDOT-PSS) support, and then Pt nanoparticles (NPs) were uniformly anchored for the anodic process of DMFCs. Characterization techniques, e.g. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed that the dispersity and homogeneity of Pt NPs on the surface of SiO2-NH2@PEDOT-PSS were markedly improved due to PEDOT-PSS modification, and the distribution of Pt NPs was in a smaller mean-size similar to 2.8 nm. Subsequently, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study exposed fast electron shift phenomenon from SiO2-NH2@PEDOT-PSS support to Pt NPs in the catalyst. The various electrochemical tests such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry (CA) and impedance spectroscopy (EIS) revealed that the prepared Pt/SiO2-NH2@PEDOT-PSS catalyst presented higher electrocatalytic efficacy, excellent durability with improved CO-tolerance towards methanol oxidation reaction rather than commercial Pt/C catalyst. These distinctive physical and chemical features of designed catalyst raise the spirit to design an efficient electrocatalyst based on Pt/SiO2-NH2@PEDOT-PSS in DMFC applications.

TI  - Nickel-graphene nanocomposite with improved electrochemical performance for La0.7Mg0.3(Ni0.85Co0.15)(3.5) electrode
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A Ni-rGO nanocomposite was synthesized by a hydrothermal process and La0.7Mg0.3(Ni0.85Co0.15)(3,5), an AB(3.5)-type hydrogen storage alloy, was prepared by magnetic levitation melting under argon atmosphere. The influences of the Ni-rGO nanocomposite on the hydrogen storage and electrochemical performance of the La0.7Mg0.3(Ni0.85Co0.15)(3.5) alloy were investigated via pressure composition isotherms (PCT) and electrochemical measurements. The PCT curves revealed that the addition of the Ni-rGO nanocomposite improved the reversibility of hydrogen absorption and desorption for the La0.7Mg0.3(Ni0.85Co0.15)(3.5) alloy. The electrochemical measurements showed that the electrochemical impedance of the La0.7Mg0.3(Ni0.85Co0.15)(3.5) alloy electrode was significantly reduced, the high rate dischargeability, HRD1200, increased from 60% to 86%, the limiting current density, I-L, increased from 1216.7 mA.g(-1) to 2287.6 mA.g(-2), and the hydrogen diffusion coefficient, D, increased with the added Ni-rGO nanocomposite. These improvements to the electrochemical performance are mainly attributed to the Ni-rGO framework, with the large specific surface area of the graphene, and to the high conductivity of metal nickel.

TI  - Ultra-low Au decorated PtNi alloy nanoparticles on carbon for high-efficiency electro-oxidation of methanol and formic acid
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We provide a simple method to design and prepare a highly efficient Pt10.9Au0.2Ni88.9/C trimetallic nanocatalyst with a novel nanostructure of ultra-low (0.075 wt%) Au decorated PtNi alloy nanoparticles for methanol oxidation (MOR) and formic acid oxidation (FAOR). The electro-catalytic properties of Pt10.9Au0.2Ni88.9/C toward the MOR and FAOR are much more excellent than Pt-11.1/Ni-88.9/C, Au-11.1/Ni-88.9/C and commercial Pt/C, which is attributable to the synergy effect among Pt, Au, and Ni (electron charge donor effect of Au and Ni to Pt). It has transformed the surface electronic structure of Pt atoms. Moreover, Ni triggers the rearrange towards Pt and Au atoms, it could maximize the use of noble metals. The gold atoms decorated on the surface are conducive to the formation of OH a d s as well as to weaken the adsorption of COads at platinum active sites. The Pt10.9Au0.2Ni88.9/C catalyst also exhibits outstanding stability during the MOR and FAOR. A series of characterization techniques are adopted to reveal the nanostructures, electronic, and surficial active sites properties of Pt10.9Au0.2Ni88.9/C. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Well dispersed Pt nanoparticles on commercial carbon black oxidized by ozone possess significantly high electro-catalytic activity for methanol oxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the electro-catalytic methanol oxidation on the commercial carbon black treated with ozone at different temperatures to support platinum (Pt) nanoparticles was investigated. The necessary techniques like transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption techniques, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) have been used to discovery the composition, morphology and structure of the catalysts. The electro-catalytic methanol oxidation activity and durability of the catalysts was estimated by the cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometric techniques. The results indicated that the platinum nanoparticles with average sizes of 2.04 nm can be uniformly dispersed on the surfaces of carbon black oxidized by ozone at 140 degrees C. In the meanwhile it has significantly high electro-catalytic activity for methanol oxidation. This phenomenon is attributed to the fact that ozone oxidation increase the content of oxygen-containing groups on the carbon black, which is helpful for improving the dispersion and decreasing the size of platinum nanoparticles. Oxygen-containing groups play a critical role in enhancing the performance of methanol electro-oxidation. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Sulfonic acid functionalized graphene oxide paper sandwiched in sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone): A proton exchange membrane with high performance for semi-passive direct methanol fuel cells
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) membranes have been deposited on the both sides of a sulfonic acid functionalized graphene oxide (SGO) paper to form a proton exchange membrane (PEM) with a sandwiched structure. The obtained SPEEK/SGO/SPEEK membrane could exhibit proton conductivity close to Nafion (R) 112 and lower methanol permeability. The use of this SPEEK/SGO/SPEEK membrane greatly improves the performance of the semi-passive direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC). The semi-passive DMFC with the SPEEK/SGO/SPEEK membrane is found to be capable of delivering the peak power density 60% higher than that with the commercial Nafion (R) 112. This, along with its comparable durability to Nafion (R) 112, strongly suggests the great promise of using the SPEEK/SGO/SPEEK membrane as the PEM. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Enhanced room-temperature hydrogen storage capacity in Pt-loaded graphene oxide/HKUST-1 composites
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Series of Pt-loaded graphene oxide (GO)/HKUST-1 composites were synthesized by the reaction between Pt@GO and precursors of HKUST-1. The parent materials and composites have been characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Infrared (IR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and gas adsorption analyzer. The XRD and IR analysis showed that the incorporation of Pt@GO did not prevent the formation of HKUST-1 units. SEM, TEM and EDS results revealed that Pt nanoparticles were well-dispersive and anchored tightly into composites. Meanwhile, the percentage of Pt@GO has an obvious effect on morphologies, crystallinities and surface areas of composites. More importantly, the significant enhancement of hydrogen storage capacity at ambient temperature for the composite with low Pt@GO content can be ascribed to the hydrogen spillover mechanism in such system.

TI  - The supporting of Co-2(OH)PO4 onto N, P Co-Doped graphene via an in-situ hydrothermal assembly synthesis for efficient oxygen reduction reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing efficient and durable non-noble catalysts toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is an ongoing challenge. Herein, a highly efficient ORR catalyst (Co-NPG) is explored by assembling Co-2(OH)PO4 on conductive nitrogen, phosphate co-doped graphene (NPG) via an in-situ hydrothermal process. The graphene oxide matrix ammoniated by ethylenediamine not only constructs stable building blocks for hosting active sites, but also induces strong interaction between assembled cobalt-based nanoparticles. Morphology characterizations demonstrate the formation of the bulk-like structure with rough surface for the hybrid. Electrochemical measurements confirm this designed catalyst displays more efficient ORR performance than the un-ammoniated graphene oxide based one, and even comparable to that of 20 wt% Pt/C under the identical experimental conditions. The high ORR activity of the hybrid originates from the joint effects of the four aspects: first, the ammoniated graphene oxide tends to induce stronger NPs interaction than graphene oxide due to polarization, causing higher electronic conductivity and resulting in orientated growth; second, the N and P co-doping effects modulate the electronic structure of graphene, exposing more defects; third, the hybrid employs a high specific BET surface area and mesoporous characteristics, which afford quick mass transport during the ORR process; last, the synergistic coupling between the formed Co-2(OH)PO4 and NPG plays a critical role.

TI  - Phosphoric acid-doped ionic liquid-functionalized graphene oxide/sulfonated polyimide composites as proton exchange membrane
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A series of sulfonated polyimide (SPI) composite proton exchange membranes with different contents of an ionic liquid-functionalized graphene oxide (FGO) were prepared in order to study the effects of FGO fillers on the membranes properties. Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized by the modified Hummers method and then was functionalized with 1-methylimidazole. The phosphoric acid-doped FGO nanosheets were incorporated into the sulfonated polyimide for preparation of composite proton exchange membranes. The sulfonated polyimide (SPI) was synthesized via a solution imidization method. A series of techniques such as FT-IR, H-1-NMR, XRD and XPS were used for the characterization of synthesized materials. The membranes properties such as thermal and mechanical stability, morphology, water uptake, phosphoric acid uptake and proton conductivity were investigated. The proton conductivities of the membranes were measured as a function of temperature in ambient humidity and also 80% relative humidity (RH) conditions. The pure SPI showed its maximum proton conductivities of 0.0282 and 0.0864 S cm(-1) at ambient and 80% RH, respectively, while SPI/FGO 5% showed the maximum proton conductivity values of 0.0772 5 cm(-1) (at 160 degrees C and ambient humidity) and 0.1243 S cm(-1) (at 120 degrees C and 80% RH) among all of the samples.

TI  - High performance graphene oxide/NiAl2O4 directly grown on carbon cloth hybrid for oxygen evolution reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the lethargic kinetics, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) requires a high anodic voltage, restricting the efficiency as well as practical applications for electrochemical water splitting. For this purpose, metal oxides (M -O) are viewed as a potential competitor in this search because of their high redox potential. Still, their low conductivity and instability are two significant barriers that must be addressed. In this study the nanocomposite of NiAl2O4 with graphene oxide (GO) as a highly effective and long-lasting electrocatalyst for OER has been fabricated. In an alkaline (1.0 M KOH) medium, the GO/NiAl2O4 responds to a very sharp overpotential of 219 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and with a lower value of tafel slope (43 mV/dec) as compared to its counterparts. The GO/NiAl2O4 corresponds to the high stability of 18 h with retained crystal structure and morphology. For the expected prolonged OER process, we assume the active redox couple due to the presence of Ni thorn 2/ thorn 3 metal in NiAl2O4 varies periodically. Furthermore, the synergistic effect of NiAl2O4, com-bined with the GO, facilitates the dynamics of O2 evolution as a final product, and are useful for further applications in future era.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Emergent hierarchical porosity by ZIF-8/GO nanocomposite increases oxygen electroreduction activity of Pt nanoparticles
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hierarchically porous materials are promising as catalyst supports in fuel cells and batteries as they increase overall mass transfer and active site density. In this work, a hierarchically porous catalyst support for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acidic media has been developed by a bottom-up approach. Graphene oxide (GO) was introduced during synthesis conditions of zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) to produce hybrid material of ZIF-8/GO. Successful nanocomposite formation was realized by preserved crystallinity and chemical interaction between species as revealed by X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Introduction of GO and pyrolysis of resulting hybrid structure causes emergence of disordered meso/macropores with an accompanying increase in pore volume as revealed by N-2 sorption experiments. Pt nanoparticle deposition on pyrolyzed hybrid material by polyol method results in electrocatalyst Pt/NC-1, which shows greatly improved mass activity (182 vs 86 A g(pt)(-1)) and specific activity (467 vs 186 mu A g(pt)(-1)) at 0.8 V for ORR against reference electrocatalyst Pt/r-GO and improved specific activity against Pt/C.

TI  - Efficient photothermocatalytic hydrogen production performance over a graphene-titanium dioxide hybrid nanomaterial
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Here, Graphene@TiO2 nanomaterials were prepared for photothermocatalytic H-2 production to make full-use of solar spectrum. The H-2 evolution rate (HER) was 17.6 mmol/h and 89.8 mmol/h at room temperature and 90 degrees C, respectively. Interestingly, it could sharply increase to 436.5 mmol/h when the temperature reached 110 degrees C, which was about 24.8 times that of under room temperature. The introduction of graphene effectively promoted the specific surface area and pore volume of the composite, thus, contributing to the quick diffusion of reactants. Meanwhile, graphene absorbed and converted the energy of long wavelength photons into heat via photothermal effect, thus, enhancing the temperature of reaction system. The enhanced HER might be attributed to the existence of gas-liquid two-phase flow in micro boiling state, the strengthened migration/diffusion rate of sacrificial reagent molecules, and as well as the excitation of adsorbed reactant molecules stemming from the elevated temperature. Our work should be valuable for the design of novel and efficient photothermocatalytic hydrogen production system driven by full-spectrum of sun light. (c) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Hydrogen spillover at sub-2 nm Pt nanoparticles by electrochemical hydrogen loading
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrogen generation and storage is an essential component in the increasingly important field of energy storage. Electrochemical generation of hydrogen atoms at the surface of Pt like metals at select potentials is a widely accepted phenomenon. However, moving these adsorbed hydrogen atoms to high surface area support systems for storage is an issue. We show spillover of these adsorbed hydrogen atoms to the supporting structure for sub-2 nm Pt nanoparticles sputtered on Fluorine Doped Tin Oxide (FTO) and on few layer graphene (FLG) supports. Evidence of size-dependent hydrogen spillover was observed for Pt nanoparticles deposited using tilted target sputtering and a correlation between nanoparticle size, crystallinity, support characteristics, and hydrogen spillover is also reported. Evidence of C-H bonds formed on the FLG surface due to H spillover from 0.9 nm Pt nanoparticles was also confirmed through XPS analysis.

TI  - Agent-free synthesis of graphene oxide/transition metal oxide composites and its application for hydrogen storage
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Graphene oxide (GO) wrapped transition metal oxide composite materials were synthesized by a very simple route without any additional agents and the hydrogen adsorption properties of the materials were investigated. The morphologies of GO/V2O5 and GO/TiO2 were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results show that single- or few-layered GO sheets wrapped throughout the V2O5 and TiO2 particles. According to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the C-OH species of GO and the surface-adsorbed oxygen of the transition metal oxide bond together via a dehydration reaction. The wrapping phenomenon of GO causes the enhancement of hydrogen storage capacity at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) compared with those of the pristine transition metal oxides and GO. The enhancement of hydrogen storage capacity of GO-wrapped transition metal oxide composite materials results from the existence of interspaces between the transition metal oxide particles and the thin GO layers.

TI  - Efficient visible-light-driven photocatalytic hydrogen production from water by using Eosin Y-sensitized novel g-C3N4/Pt/GO composites
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing an efficient dye-sensitized photocatalyst for photocatalytic H-2 evolution from water is highly desired. In this study, a novel ternary g-C3N4/Pt/GO composite was synthesized via a facile liquid-phase sonochemical approach. Pt nanoparticles were firstly deposited on the surfaces and/or interlayer of g-C3N4 by chemical reduction, and then, GO was penetrated through ultrasonic treatment. This preparation method is facilitated to prohibit the agglomeration of g-C3N4 and GO because of their pi-pi stacking interaction and enhance electrons transport and the adsorption of dye molecules. The Eosin Y-sensitized ternary g-C3N4/Pt/GO composite shows the highest H-2 production rate of 3.82 mmol center dot g(-1)center dot h(-1) under the optimization conditions, which about 2.1 times and 7.7 times higher than the Eosin Y-sensitized binary g-C3N4/Pt and GO/Pt photocatalysts, respectively. The improved charge separation efficiency is the main reason for the enhancement in H-2 evolution activity. The apparent quantum efficiency of hydrogen evolution for the Eosin Y-sensitized ternary g-C3N4/Pt/GO composite is up to 9.7% at 420 nm. Moreover, the sensitized g-C3N4/Pt/GO composite shows stable photocatalytic activity for H-2 evolution under visible light irradiation. The effect of pH, g-C3N4/GO weight ratios, Pt loading amounts, dye concentrations, and different type dyes on the H-2 evolution activity was also investigated in detail.

TI  - Non-enzymatic electrochemical hydrogen peroxide biosensor based on reduction graphene oxide-persimmon tannin-platinum nanocomposite
T2  - MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING C-MATERIALS FOR BIOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is one of the most universal and essential ingredients in distinct biological tissues. Herein, a novel non-enzymatic sensor based on reduction graphene oxide-persimmon tannin-platinum nanocomposite (RGO-PT-Pt) was exploited for H2O2 detection. RGO-PT-Pt nanocomposite was prepared by reduction procedure with ascorbic acid as reducing agent and characterized by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultraviolet visible spectroscopy (UV-vis) and Fourier infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Taking advantage of high electro-catalytic efficiency of Pt nanoparticles, high electronic conductivity and large surface area of RGO, and significant adsorption ability of PT on metal ions and its prevention of agglomeration to promote RGO dispersion, RGO-PT-Pt nanocomposite revealed better catalytic ability towards H2O2 via a synergistic effect. Under the optimal conditions, the RGO-PT-Pt non-enzymatic biosensor exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic activity towards H2O2 reduction. The amperometric response demonstrated a linear relationship with H2O2 concentration from 1.0 to 100 mu M with the correlation coefficient of 0.9931. The limit of detection was 0.26 mu M (S/N = 3) and the response time was 3 s. Furthermore, the fabricated sensor exhibited a practical applicability in the quantification of H2O2 in human serum samples with an excellent recovery rate. Due to excellent performance such as fast response time, low detection limit, high stability and selectivity, the RGO-PT-Pt non-enzymatic biosensor has potential application in clinical diagnostics.

TI  - Porous honeycomb-like NiSe2/red phosphorus heteroarchitectures for photocatalytic hydrogen production
T2  - NANOSCALE
M3  - Article
AB  - Heterojunction construction of semiconductors with a matched bandgap can not only help promote visible light absorption but also restrain photoexcited charge carrier recombination and optimize the separation efficiency. Herein, a novel porous honeycomb-like NiSe2/RP heterostructure is reported for the first time by in situ deposition of NiSe2 nanoparticles on the surface of red phosphorus (RP). The optimized binary NiSe2/RP composite showed superior photocatalytic H-2 evolution activity (1968.8 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) from Na2S/Na2SO3 solution under solar light illumination, which was 2.32, 1.90, 1.59 and 1.21 times that of pristine RP, NiSe2, 5.3% FeS/RP and 8.1% NiS/RP, respectively. The formation process and function of various reactive oxygen species (& x2d9;OH, & x2d9;O-2(-) and H2O2), and the migration pathway of photocarriers are discussed in detail. Such a prominently improved photocatalytic performance could be ascribed to extended light absorption ability, massive reactive centers and lower interfacial transfer resistance, together with expedited charge separation, which arose from a successive two-electron/two-step reduction route. This study provides illuminating insights for the rational exploration and fabrication of potential photocatalytic systems with 0D/3D integrated nanoarchitecture and a multi-step electron transfer process for efficiently realizing solar energy capture and conversion.

TI  - Synthesis of GO-modified Cu2O nanosphere and the photocatalytic mechanism of water splitting for hydrogen production
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A new one-step method for synthesize cuprous oxide nanosphere without any additive surfactant in room temperature and atmospheric pressure was carried. The nanospheres with the diameters less than 100 nm were well-dispersed and formed the core shell structure with the GO. The partial reduction of GO increases the atomic percentage of sp(2) carbon (graphene sheets). It was found that sp(2) carbon with better conductivity plays an important role in mitigating electron hole recombination and enhancing electron transfer between Cu2O and GO and thus enhance the photocatalytic activity. The highest hydrogen yields for GO-modified samples (118.3 p.mol) were more than twice as large as that of bare Cu2O nanosphere (44.6 umol). 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - N-spirocyclic ammonium-functionalized graphene oxide-based anion exchange membrane for fuel cells
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Graphene oxide (GO) is a potential material in the electrode and membrane of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells due to its unique structure and various oxygen-containing functional groups. A class of three-layered GO/poly (phenylene oxide) for AEMs was prepared in this work. GO was functionalized with highly stable 6-azonia-spiro [5.5]undecane groups and used as a fast hydroxide conductor, named ASU-GO. Functionalized by N-spirocyclic cations, poly (phenylene oxide) (PIPPO) was then combined with ASU-GO and GO to fabricate the ASU-GO/ PIPPO and GO/PIPPO. Notably, the maximum hydroxide conductivity of the ASU-GO/PIPPO was 73.7 mS cm(-1) at 80 degrees C, which was 3 times higher than that of the GO/PIPPO. The enhancement in hydroxide conductivity was due to the changes in the hydroxide transport mechanism and the poor stacked structure of the ASU- GO layer. Only 10.8% drops in hydroxide conductivity of ASU-GP/PIPPO after the alkaline test (1 M KOH at 80 degrees C for 700 h). Furthermore, the ASU-GO/PIPPO-50 membrane showed a maximum peak power density of 102 mW cm(-2), demonstrating the prepared membrane was promising in the AEM applications.

TI  - High electrocatalytic activity and stability of PtAg supported on rutile TiO2 for methanol oxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rutile TiO2 is used as a support for the PtAg nanoparticles, and the catalytic activity and stability of PtAg/TiO2 for the electrooxidation of methanol are investigated. The PtAg nanoparticles with a Pt:Ag atomic ratio of 1:1 are prepared by the chemical co-reduction of the precursors of Pt and Ag, and physical characterizations reveal that the PtAg nanoparticles are evenly dispersed on TiO2. PtAg/TiO2 shows significantly higher catalytic activity and stability than PtAg/C, Pt/TiO2 and Pt/C for methanol oxidation in both alkaline and acidic solutions, indicating that rutile TiO2 is superior to carbon black as supports and PtAg is superior to Pt in achieving high catalytic activity. Rutile TiO2 is also shown to be superior to anatase TiO2 as supports for the PtAg nanoparticles. The results of this study suggest high potential of rutile TiO2 as a support material for electrocatalysts. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - One-pot synthesis of MoS2/CdS nanosphere heterostructures for efficient H-2 evolution under visible light irradiation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploration of cost-efficient and high-performance photocatalyst for H-2 evolution by using a facile approach is of great importance. In this manuscript, a facile one -pot method was employed to fabricate MoS2/CdS heterostructures with MoS2 intimately grown on the surface of CdS resulting in the formation of well-defined heterostructures. Screen experiment reveals the optimized photocatalytic H-2 evolution performance of MoS2/CdS is far exceeding that of pristine CdS by a factor of more than 162. The outstanding performance can be ascribed to the formation of heterostructures which accelerate charge transportation and separation, and the MoS2 serving as a cocatalyst for the decrease of H-2 overpotential. Moreover, the photocatalytic mechanism of the MoS2/CdS was carefully investigated, which contributes to the deep understanding of the photocatalytic process and the designation of other low-cost and high-efficient photocatalyst.

TI  - Titanate nanotube modified with different nickel precursors for enhanced Eosin Y-sensitized photocatalytic hydrogen evolution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nickel species were loaded on titanate nanotubes (TNT) as a hydrogen evolution cocatalyst by an impregnation-calcination method. Nickel chloride, nickel nitrate and nickel acetate were used as the precursors. More Ni2+ ions intercalate into the interlayer of TNT when nickel chloride is used as the precursor. In the calcination process, the titanate transforms into anatase TiO2, and Ni2+ ions are reduced and doped partly in TiO2 and titanate. The Ni2+ ions intercalated into TNT inner can promote the phase transformation, growth of metal Ni particles and the Ni2+ doping. The formed Ni particles can be oxidized in air to form core/shell Ni@NiO structure. The Ni2+ doping promotes the formation of oxygen defects and increases the conductivity of TNT. The photocatalytic activity of Eosin Y-sensitized nickel-modified TNT for hydrogen evolution was investigated. The TNT modified with nickel chloride exhibit higher activity, which can be attributed to the higher conductivity and more effective formation of Ni@NiO structure.

CL  - Gwangju City, SOUTH KOREA
AB  - In this study, low-loading palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) were prepared on a graphene oxide-manganese oxide (GE/MO) support using a one-pot, eco-friendly "green" process. The GE/MO-Pd nanocomposite was characterized by powder X ray diffraction, Raman, scanning microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The elemental composition was determined using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and the electronic state of the materials was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The GB/MO-Pd nanocomposite exhibited high electrocatalydc activity towards ethylene glycol oxidation in alkaline medium. The GB/MO-Pd electrode demonstrated a forward anodic peak current density of 3.8 mA/cm(2), which was higher than both MO-Pd and GR-Pd electrodes. This excellent catalytic activity, low onset potential, better intermediate tolerance and good long-term stability of the GB/MO-Pd electrode could be attributed to the uniform dispersion of Pd NPs over the GE/MO support. This work outlines a new method for simple, fast and eco-friendly fabrication of a catalyst with high electrochemical performance and potential in alcohol fuel cell applications.

AB  - We report the application of plasmonic Bi nanoparticles supported rGO/BiVO4 anode for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Nearly, 2.5 times higher activity was observed for Bi-rGO/BiVO4 composite than pristine BiVO4. Typical results indicated that Bi-rGO/BiVO4 exhibits the highest current density of 6.05 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V, whereas Bi BiVO4 showed the current density of only 3.56 mA/cm(2). This enhancement in PEC activity on introduction of Bi-rGO is due to the surface plasmonic behavior of BiNPs, which improves the absorption of radiation thereby reduces the charge recombination. Further, the composite electrode showed good solar to hydrogen conversion efficiency, appreciable incident photon-to-current efficiency and low charge transfer resistance. Hence, Bi-rGO/BiVO4 provides an opportunity to realize PEC water splitting. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Challenges arising from the use of TiO2/rGO/Pt photocatalysts to produce hydrogen from crude glycerol compared to synthetic glycerol
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Photoreforming has emerged as a novel technology expected to obtain chemical energy through solar energy transformation. In this way, sustainable valorization of glycerol, a biodiesel by-product, to clean fuels is a promising alternative to help meet the world's growing energy demand. In this work, TiO2/rGO(x)/Pt(y) photocatalysts have been developed for hydrogen production from synthetic and crude glycerol solutions. The effect of several key operating parameters (including vol% of glycerol, pH, catalyst loading, wt% of GO, wt% of Pt, temperature, and light source) on hydrogen production rate has been studied. The results indicated different optimal operating parameters depending on glycerol origin, achieving up to 70.8 and 12.7 mmol h(-1) g(-1) of hydrogen using synthetic glycerol and crude glycerol, respectively. Additionally, GO nanosheets and Pt nanoparticles strongly influenced the hydrogen production rate but not the overall reaction mechanism. Impurities contented in crude glycerol are key factors in developing realistic hydrogen production processes. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Synthesis and electrochemical study of Cd@Pd core/shell nanomaterials for hydrogen sorption and storage
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a great interest in the development of advanced hydrogen absorbing materials for hydrogen purification and storage. Palladium has strong potential to play a major role in many aspects of a hydrogen based economy, leading to promising applications, encompassing hydrogen purification, storage, and detection. Here, we report on the synthesis of novel Cd@Pd core/shell nanostructured materials for hydrogen sorption and storage. The effect of a capping agent was investigated, showing that it plays an important role in the formation of the uniform and small size of the Cd@Pd nanostructures. Our study has shown that the capacity for hydrogen sorption and storage depended strongly on the composition and structure of the formed Pd-based nanomaterials, as well as the applied electrode potential. The Cd@Pd core/shell nanostructure with an optimized composition of 1:2 exhibited the highest capacity for hydrogen storage, and a 340% increase was achieved in comparison with pure Pd nanoparticles. In addition, by using Cd as the core, the potentially negative environmental impact due to the toxicity of the Cd species was minimized. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

TI  - Pre-deposited Co nanofilms promoting high alloying degree of PdxAu nanoparticles as electrocatalysts in alkaline media
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 18th Conference of China-Association-for-Hydrogen-Energy (CAHE)
CL  - Guangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - High alloyed and well dispersed PdxAu nanoparticles are deposited on pre-deposited Co nanofilm substrates (PdxAu/Co-nanofilms/C) by using an immiscible ionic liquid (IL)/water interface. However, low alloyed PdxAu/C catalysts are formed without pre-deposited Co nanofilms through the same synthesis method. The high-alloyed PdxAu/Co-nanofilms/C catalysts demonstrate significantly increased activity for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) than low-alloyed PdxAu/C of the same Pd/Au composition, with the catalysts of low Pd/Au atom ratio (Pd:Au = 1:1) demonstrating the optimal activity. Notably, high alloyed degree of the PdxAu nanoparticles in the PdxAu/Co-nanofilms/C catalysts brings the lattice expansion of Pd, causing an up-shift of the d-band center, which results in the enhancement of OH- adsorption and correspondingly promotes electro-oxidation of ethanol excluding the effect of Co nanofilm substrates. Differently, the enhancement activities of the Pd-Au bimetallic system for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are almost not affected by the alloying degree and only dependent on Pd/Au atom ratios, with the catalysts of low Pd/Au atom ratio (Pd:Au = 1:1) displaying the highest ORR mass activity, respectively. These results exhibit the specific dependence between the different electrochemical process and the physical parameters for the Pd-Au bimetallic system. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mesoporous manganese oxide was prepared by a non-ionic surfactant route using Triton X-100, followed by Ag nanoparticle (NP) and graphene oxide incorporation by an ultra-sonication-assisted process. Fine Ag NPs were incorporated into the tubular texture of mesoporous manganese oxide. The crystalline phase, particle size, and morphology of the prepared materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Barrett-Joyner-Halenda-Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis, scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray analysis, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). The XRD results confirmed the formation of the Mn2O3 phase for the as-prepared mesoporous manganese oxide and its nanocomposite. Very fine Ag NPs (<5-10 nm) were obtained. The mesoporous MnO2 and graphene-incorporated Ag NPs/meso-MnO2 had a tubular structure and "flaky pastry"-type morphology for the synthesized nanocomposites. HR-TEM images further confirmed the beautiful structural formation upon graphene addition and spherical/dot-shaped NP incorporation into the matrix of MnO2. Improved surface area was obtained for the Ag NPs and graphene-incorporated mesoporous MnO2 as compared to bulk MnO2. The Cr(VI) removal analysis was performed using a batch technique, and enhanced removal of Cr(VI) was achieved (>98% removal of Cr(VI) within 1-2 h of reaction time) for Ag NP-incorporated mesoporous MnO2.

TI  - One-step hydrothermal synthesis of Zn(x)Cdi(1-x)S/ZnO heterostructures for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Photocatalytic hydrogen generation from water is an appealing strategy for solar energy conversion, and fabricating heterostructured photocatalysts is demonstrated to be an effective way to improve the photocatalytic performance. Herein, we applied a facile one-step hydrothermal method to construct ZnxCd1-xS/ZnO heterostructures for photocatalytic hydrogen production. By varying the initial S2-/Cd2+ molar ratio, the composition, structure, and morphology of ZnxCd1-xS/ZnO heterostructures could be gradually tuned. It was demonstrated that the photocatalytic activity of ZnxCd1-xS/ZnO first increased and then underwent a decrease with the increased S2-/Cd2+ molar ratio. ZnxCd1-xS/ZnO sample showed a highest photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of 1.89 mmol/h with an apparent quantum yield of 26.0% at 420 nm. To our knowledge, this value was the highest for the reported ZnxCd1-xS/ZnO composite photocatalysts. The excellent performance could be attributed to the balance of the light absorption and conduction band offset of ZnxCd1-xS/ZnO heterostructures, as well as the intimate contact of two components at the interface. This work not only provided a facile one-step route to fabricate efficient composite photocatalysts, but also demonstrated the importance of balancing the band-gap and band offset of heterostructured photocatalysts for the improved hydrogen production.

TI  - The use of CeO2-modified Pt/C catalyst inks for the construction of high-performance enzyme-free H2O2 sensors
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, the development of novel enzyme-free electrochemical hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) sensors with high sensitivity and wide linear range is described. The electrochemical sensors were constructed by the physical modification of commercial Pt/C catalysts with CeO2 metal oxide nanoparticles. X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N-2-adsorption, and Raman spectroscopy methods were used to characterize the metal oxide nanoparticles. The CeO2 particles showed fluorite-type structure with the average crystalline size of 13.8 nm. Furthermore, the Raman spectroscopy results indicated the presence of high degree of oxygen defects indicating the high redox property of the nanoparticles. The physical surface area of the metal oxide nanoparticles was determined to be 68.8 m(2)g(-1). The catalyst inks were prepared by mixing commercial Pt/C and CeO2 nanoparticles with different weight ratios. The analytical performance of the sensors was studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA) methods. The results revealed that the introduction of CeO2 nanoparticles into the catalyst layer improved the sensor performance significantly compared to Pt/C sensors. A high sensitivity of 185.4 +/- 6.5 mu A mM(-1)cm(-2) was obtained from CeO2-modified sensors in a wide linear range of 0.01-30 mM. Depending on the obtained results it can be suggested that the novel sensor design holds a great promise for the construction of electrochemical sensors with high sensitivity, selectivity, and wide working window.

TI  - 3D carbon aerogel-supported PtNi intermetallic nanoparticles with high metal loading as a durable oxygen reduction electrocatalyst
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Highly active and cost-effective oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts that have high metal loading and enhanced durability are desirable for the practical application in direct methanol fuel cells. Here, the preparation of a three dimensional (3D) carbon-based aerogel (CA) composed of graphene and multi-walled carbon nanotubes is reported and used as a support for an ordered PtNi intermetallic catalyst (O-PtNi/CA) with a metal loading of 80 wt %. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopic measurements confirm the formation of highly dispersed ordered PtNi intermetallic nanoparticles with a mean particle size of ca. 15.0 +/- 1.0 nm. The as-prepared catalyst exhibits enhanced activity and durability for the ORR when compared to the Pt/C catalyst from BASF. The mass and specific activities of the ORR at 0.90 V on O-PtNi/CA is ca. 1.4 and 1.8 times higher, respectively, than that using the commercial PVC catalyst. After an accelerated stress test, the mean particle size of the O-PtNi/CA catalyst nearly kept unchanged. Both the improved activity and durability of the O-Pt-Ni/CA catalyst could be ascribed to the formation of an intermetallic compound, the uniform dispersion of PtNi nanoparticles, and the 3 D structure of the support.

TI  - Efficient electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction and solar activity via bi-functional GO/Co3O4-TiO2 nano hybrid structure
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Highly proficient electro and solar catalyst of mixed metal oxides Co3O4-TiO2 modified with graphene oxide (GO) have been synthesized by simple and cost-effective way using sol-gel methodology. This catalyst demonstrated versatile bi-functional features towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in catalytic water splitting along with solar photo catalytic activity in the degradation of Methyl Orange (MO). XRD profile confirmed that composite presented an anatase and cubic phase for TiO2 and Co3O4, respectively, with the GO network. The morphological structures confirm flaky texture of Co3O4 with small irregular spheres of TiO2 nanoparticles randomly dispersed on the broken sheets of GO. GO and clusters of Co2+/Co3+ in different regions of host TiO2 are accountable for decreasing band gap in the composite samples. Co-O-Ti and Co-Ti-C linkages in the composite materials are confirmed by Raman and FTIR studies. In electro catalytic HER in alkaline medium GO/Co3O4-TiO2 catalyst illustrated low onset potential similar to 343 mV vs. RHE, high current density similar to 43 mA cm(-2) corresponding small Tafel slope similar to 97 mV/dec and small R-ct as compared to other catalysts. For HER in GO/Co3O4-TiO2, Co2+ sites are more catalytically active than Co3+ sites along with Ti4+ and GO provides the more active surface area by reducing the agglomeration between the mixed metal oxides. GO/Co3O4-TiO2 shows the highest photo catalytic performance over MO as compared to binary and ternary composites. Pining of metal oxides with reactive oxygen functional moieties of GO considerably improve the photo catalytic degradation activity and helpful in the separation of charge carriers for HER.

TI  - Reduced graphene oxide supported nickel tungstate nano-composite electrocatalyst for anodic urea oxidation reaction in direct urea fuel cell
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent time direct urea fuel cell (DUFC) emerges as a potential candidate for sustainable urea reach wastewater treatment and power generation. The efficiency of DUFC mainly governed by the anodic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) kinetics. The design and development of efficient electrocatlysts for UOR remains a key factor for practical utilization of DUFC. In current study, we present a single step hydrothermal synthesis of NiWO4 NPs/rGO (h-NiWO4 NPs/rGO) composite for UOR catalysis in alkaline medium. The synthesized NiWO4 NPs/rGO composite offers a 218 mA/cm(2) UOR catalytic current density. Moreover, the h-NiWO4 NPs/rGO composite retains its 94% UOR catalytic current after 1000 cyclic voltammetric cycles. Further, h-NiWO4 NPs/rGO composite shows superior UOR catalytic performance than physical mixture of NiWO4 NPs and rGO, NiWO4 NPs, NiO/WO3 physical mixture and only NiO with reference to catalytic current density, onset potential, and durability. The enhanced electrocatalytic activity of the h-NiWO4 NPs/rGO composite attributed to the synergetic coupling of physiochemical properties of NiWO4 NPs and rGO which improves the charge transfer generates larger electroactive surface and reduces catalyst poisoning. An air cathode DUFC with h-NiWO4 NPs/rGO composite modified anode and Pt/C cathode produces a maximum power density of 5.1 mW/cm(2) and 927 mV open circuit potential.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Photo-electro-catalytic degradation of antibiotics such as berberine in water with simultaneous hydrogen evolution is an attractive option. It can control pollution using solar energy and provide clean energy. The photo electrodes play vital role in this kind of photocatalytic electrolytic cell. To obtain better electrode with high degradation capacity and fast hydrogen generation rate, using a facile one-pot hydrothermal process, a series of nano-structured composite FeMoO4-GO (graphene oxide) catalysts with improved absorbance in 250-800 nm were synthesized, and loaded on CFC (carbon fiber cloth). Their photo electrode performance were compared. Using SEM(scanning electron microscope), XRD (X-ray diffraction) and XPS(X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy), the catalysts were characterized, and LSV(linear sweep voltammetry), CV(cyclic voltammetry) and EIS(electrochemical impedance) were used to characterize the electrodes. In 1 M KCl supporting electrolyte, at current density 10 mA cm(-2), 90% berberine was removed in 30 min and hydrogen generation rate was 3.1 mu mol cm(-2) min(-1) in photo-electro-catalysis system. The results show rapid hydrogen generation and enhanced pollutant degradation. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane and methylamine borane catalyzed by graphene supported Ru@Ni core-shell nanoparticles
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ru@Ni core-shell nanoparticles (NPs) supported on graphene have been synthesized by one-step in situ co-reduction of aqueous solution of ruthenium (III) chloride, nickel (II) chloride, and graphene oxide (GO) with ammonia borane (AB) as the reducing agent under ambient condition. The as-synthesized NPs exhibit much higher catalytic activity for hydrolytic dehydrogenation of AB than the monometallic, bimetallic alloy (RuNi/graphene), and graphene-free core-shell (Ru@Ni) counterparts. Additionally, the Ru@Ni/graphene NPs facilitate the hydrolysis of AB, with the turnover frequency (TOP) value of 340 mol H-2 min(-1) (mol Ru)(-1), which is among the highest value reported on Ru-based NPs so far, and even higher than the reversed Ni@Ru NPs. Furthermore, the as-prepared NPs exert satisfied durable stability and magnetically recyclability for the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of AB and methylamine borane (MeAB). Moreover, this simple synthetic method can be extended to other Ru-based bimetallic core-shell systems for more applications. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

TI  - Facile and green synthesis of titanate nanotube/graphene nanocomposites for photocatalytic H-2 generation from water
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A facile and green one-step method was used to prepare titanate nanotube/graphene (TNT/GR) photocatalysts via an alkaline hydrothermal process. The as-prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and photoluminescence emission spectroscopy. The photocatalytic performance was evaluated by H-2 generation from water splitting under Xe-lamp illumination. A significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity for H-2 evolution (12.1 mu mol/h) was obtained over the compostion-optimized TNT/GR composite (with 1.0 wt% GR), two times higher than that of pure TNT (4.0 mu mol/h). During hydrothermal reaction, the reduction of graphene oxide (GO) into GR without using any reducing agents and the formation of 1-D TNT were achieved simultaneously, which resulted in the direct growth of well-defined TNTs uniformly distributed on GR substrates.

TI  - High electrochemical performance of PANI/CdO nanocomposite based on graphene oxide as a hybrid electrode materials for supercapacitor application
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last decade, the production of clean and sustainable energy sources for energy storage purposes have grown dramatically due to the population growth and increasing demand for energy in the world. In this regard, supercapacitors have proved to be promising candidates in energy storage applications. Therefore, in this study, polyaniline/ cadmium oxide/graphene oxide (PANI/CdO/GO) nanocomposite was prepared by coprecipitation method to evaluate the electrochemical performance. The structural and surface properties, morphology and particle size distribution were analyzed by XRD diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), N2 adsorption-desorption, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Furthermore, the synthesized nanocomposite was applied as an active electrode material and its performance was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in terms of energy storage. The results of these tests confirmed that PANI/CdO/GO nanocomposite provides great electrochemical behavior, including specific capacity of 647 F g-1, energy density of 116.6 W h kg-1, power density of 388 W kg-1 compared to the other electrode. According to the stability test, the initial capacity maintenance was about 82% after 500 charge-discharge cycles, which indicated relatively good electrochemical stability. Moreover, the impedance spectroscopy studies showed that the nanocomposite possessed much lower internal strength and charge transfer reaction resistance in com-parison to the other synthesized materials. Based on these results, it was found that the prepared nanocomposite has a good performance in the field of energy storage.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The development of the superior Pt-free electrocatalyst for enhancing electrocatalytic activity and stability towards the EOR (ethanol oxidation reaction) and ORR (oxygen reduction reaction) are very important for the commercialization of fuel cells. In this work, the palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) deposited on titanium dioxide nanospheres (Pd-TiO2) were successfully prepared by the sonochemical reduction method. Hence, the TiO2 nanospheres were directly used as the templates for nucleation and growth of Pd NPs over their surface using PdCl4 as the Pd precursor, PVP (Polyvinylpyrrolidone) as the stabilizer, ascorbic acid (AA) as the reducing agent, and water as the solvent. The size of Pd NPs is remarkably controlled using the sequential reduction steps by adding an excess of PdCl4. The excellent electrocatalytic activity towards EOR and ORR is ascribed by the synergistic effect of the Pd nanoparticles and TiO2 nanospheres support. This unique nanocomposite should be of great benefit to the construction of commercial fuel cell systems. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Ordered proton channels constructed from deoxyribonucleic acid-functionalized graphene oxide for proton exchange membranes via electrostatic layer-by-layer deposition
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the construction strategy of proton transport channels, we design a high-performance proton exchange membrane (PEM) with ordered deoxyribonucleic acid(DNA)-functionalized graphene oxide (GO) and Nafion matrix via the electrostatic layer-by-layer deposition (ELD) technique, which is a novel method of membrane formation aided by electrostatic force. The effects of different content rations of single-strand DNA (ss-DNA) molecules and GO (ss-DNA@GO) on the proton conductivity, methanol permeability, and single cell performance of composite PEMs are investigated. The composite membrane shows a high proton conductivity of 351.8 mS cm(-1) (80 degrees C, 100%RH) but a low methanol permeability of 1.63 x 10(-7) cm(2) s(-1) at room temperature. Furthermore, the composite membranes are assembled into direct methanol fuel cells at 60 degrees C, and Nafion/DNA@GO-2/5 exhibits a maximum power density of 255.33 mW cm(-2), which is 2.42 times higher than that of pure Nafion. This work explores the application potential of DNA@GO in PEM and provides a bioinspired avenue to designing next-generation high-performance PEM for fuel cells.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - It is urgent and challenging to exploit highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts for water splitting. Bacterial cellulose based carbon nanofiber (BCCNF) is high-lighted for its 3D network structure, abundant surface functional groups and good & nbsp;conductivity. Herein, based on the different molar ratio of P/B precursor, a series of nanocotton-like Co-B-P/BCCNF electrocatalysts have been designed and prepared via a simple electroless deposition. When the molar ratio of P/B precursor is 3/7, nanocotton-like Co-B-P/BCCNF catalyst exhibits prominent catalytic performances, delivering the current density of 10 and 50 mA cm-2 at low overpotentials of only 262 and 391 mV, respectively. Besides, it exhibits long-term stability for durative OER in alkaline solution. This result indicates that nanocotton-like Co-B-P/BCCNF catalyst has great potential as OER catalysts for large-scale hydrogen production via water splitting.(c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - ZnIn2S4 nanosheets decorating WO3 nanorods core-shell hybrids for boosting visible-light photocatalysis hydrogen generation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We here report the fabrication of a core-shell WO3@ZnIn2S4 heterostructure by an interfacial seeding growth strategy, which is implemented by direct growth of ZnIn2S4 nanosheets on the surface of WO3 nanorods with forming a strong electronic interaction between two semiconductors that are beneficial for promoting the interfacial charge transfer. Systematic studies demonstrate that the WO3@ZnIn2S4 nanohybrids hold superior performance for photocatalytic hydrogen generation under visible light irradiation with a production rate of 3900 mu mol g(-1) h(-1). This work provides an effective approach to construct the direct Z-scheme photocatalytic systems for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, which would be significant for the design of more direct Z-scheme system for various photocatalytic applications.

TI  - Hydrogen sensors based on noble metal doped metal-oxide semiconductor: A review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Review
AB  - With the exhaustion of traditional energy, increasing attention has been paid on the new energy resources like H-2. Because of its inflammable and explosive properties, it is imperative and challenging to detect ppm-level H-2 during the transport and use process. This paper firstly introduces the working principles and sensing mechanism of the hydrogen sensors based on noble metal doped metal-oxide semiconductors. Then, this paper focuses on the advancement of noble metal doped metal oxide hydrogen sensors, especially the room temperature hydrogen sensors, in the recent years. At the end, we propose that fabricating semiconductors with special morphologies, using two different noble metals for bimetallic doping or composite semiconductors with 2D nanomaterials like graphene/MoS2 to improve the room temperature sensing properties towards low H-2 concentration should be the emphasis for the future work.

AB  - Development of noble metal-free catalysts for hydrogen production is one of the cores of the sustainable energy economy. Here we present results of systematic analysis of catalytic activity of Ni-Mo alloy powders in alkaline media towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Catalysts were prepared in a wide concentration range (from Ni(0.2)M0(0.8) to Ni0.9Mo0.1.), and resulted with a volcano shaped activity-composition relationship, with maximum catalytic activity achieved for the powder with nominal composition Ni0.6Mo0.4. Improved HER activity is ascribed to reduced deactivation by hydride formation and adequate hydrogen-surface energetics on Ni-Mo catalysts. In the second part, we demonstrate a novel method for electrochemical formation of NiMo@rGO composites. Prepared composite electrodes show improved electrocatalytic activity compared to both pure Ni and Ni@rGO electrodes. Activity was observed to depend on the deposition time and is contributed by two factors: (i) formation of Ni-Mo system and (ii) formation of an interfacial region with rGO. We expect that the provided activity-composition relationship in combination with novel electrochemical NiMo-rGO composite formation procedure will provide a route for the development of new highly efficient noble metal-free HER electrocatalysts.

TI  - Fabrication and characterization of gold nanoparticles and fullerene-C-60 nanocomposite film at glassy carbon electrode as potential electro-catalyst towards the methanol oxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Development of low cost anodic materials and high efficient electro-kinetics of methanol in direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) has been a promising approach. However it has not been successfully reached to market from laboratory due to its high cost and low kinetic oxidation. Both issues encounter from one of its main components, the catalyst. Therefore, present work focuses upon the development of new catalyst material and optimization of various most significant influencing parameters of a high performance DMFC. We have developed a nanocomposite material employing gold nanoparticles and fullerene-C-60 at glassy carbon electrode (AuNP@reduced-fullerene-C-60/GCE) as anode for high performance oxidation of methanol. Fullerene-C-60 was manually dropped on pre treated GCE and partially electro-reduced in KOH to make it more conductive. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were deposited on reduced-fullerene-C-60 modified electrode using cyclic voltammetry (CV). Electrochemical characterization techniques such as CV, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and chronocoulometry were used to characterize modified electrode. Modified electrode was also characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) for morphological properties. The electrochemical behavior of methanol was performed in alkaline medium using CV and chronoamperometry methods. The results revealed good electrocatalytic performance and better stability than previously reported catalysts using AuNP@reduced-fullerene-C-60 catalyst, suggesting making promising anodic material for direct methanol oxidation fuel cell.

AB  - PdNi alloy nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized and then readily assembled on the composite of cobalt ferrite NPs with Vulcan XC-72 carbon (CoFe2O4-VC). The electrocatalyst performance of the yielded PdNi/CoFe2O4-VC composite was tested in borohydride fuel cell reactions in alkaline media. The structure/morphology of colloidal CoFe2O4 and PdNi alloy NPs along with the yielded CoFe2O4-VC composite and PdNi/CoFe2O4-VC electrocatalyst were examined by TEM, powder XRD and ICP-MS. Both monodisperse CoFe2O4 and PdNi alloy NPs with 11 and 4 nm average size, respectively, were discernible over the VC support material by the TEM images of the electrocatalyst. The loading ratio of CoFe2O4 and PdNi alloy NPs in the composite was found to be 16.1 wt% and 2.7 wt%, respectively, as determined by ICP-MS. The performance of PdNi/CoFe2O4-VC as a novel electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction (ORR) and borohydride oxidation (BOR) reactions in alkaline media was studied by voltammetric techniques using a rotating disk electrode. ORR and BOR parameters such as number of exchanged electrons and kinetic current density were calculated. The results revealed that PdNi/CoFe2O4-VC electrocatalyst was highly efficient for both ORR and BOR with exchange of 3.2 and 6.6 electrons, respectively. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of MoWCoS/G and MoWCuS/G as new transition metal dichalcogenide nanocatalysts for electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction
T2  - CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - New nanocomposites based on transition metal dichalcogenides, MoWCoS and MoWCuS, were synthesized through one step hydrothermal method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) techniques as well as field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images confirmed the synthesis of nanocomposites. For investigation of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) properties of new nanocomposites, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was applied for this purpose. According to the results of similar previous works, the prepared nanocomposites showed promising HER properties as low overpotential equal to 41.4 mV/dec for MoWCoS hybridized with reduced graphene (G) and a little higher one equal to 49 mV/dec for MoWCuS hybridized with reduced graphene. Based on obtained Tafel slopes 38 and 53 mV/dec for MoWCoS/G and MoWCuS/G, respectively, the "Heyrovsky-Volmer" mechanism was suggested for the new HER three component nanocatalysts as the first effort to this purpose.

M3  - Article
AB  - Binder-free MoO3/GO/MWCNTs/graphite sheets were successfully fabricated via electro-deposition of graphene oxide and functionalized multi walled carbon nanotube onto graphite sheets followed by electrodeposition of molybdenum oxide. The capacitive behavior of the MoO3/GO/MWCNTs/G sheet was found to be superior with respect to those of MoO3/MWCNTs/graphite and MoO3/GO/G sheets. The high wettability, interconnected structure and synergetic effects between MoO3, GO and MWCNTs made the MoO3/GO/MWCNTs/G sheet exhibited a high areal capacitance of 103 mF cm(-2) at current density of 0.7 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KCl. An all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor device prepared by using the MoO3/GO/MWCNTs/G sheet as both positive and negative electrodes showed high cell voltage of 2.5 V and remarkable cycle life of 86.8% retention after 2000 cycles, suggesting the possibility for practical applications in energy storage device.

AB  - In this work, we report the synthesis, characterization and application of graphene oxide stabilized PdCo nanoparticles (PdCo GO) for the dehydrocoupling of dimethylamine borane (DMAB) as a model reaction. Bimetallic graphene oxide stabilized PdCo nano particles were readily synthesized using an ultrasonic reduction technique, in which both metals of Pd and Co were reduced with GO. The dispersion of PdCo nanoparticles on the surface of GO was enhanced with the help of the ultrasonic reduction method which result in the enhancing of dispersion of both metals without any agglomeration problem. The characterization studies revealed that graphene oxide stabilized PdCo nanoparticles have a uniform, homogeneous distribution on graphene oxide and an average particle size of 3.48 +/- 0.22 nm. After fully characterization of graphene oxide stabilized PdCo nano particles, they have been tried in model reaction as a catalyst and exhibited a high catalytic performance compared the previous catalysts in literature with a TOF value of 226.80 h(-1). The investigation of kinetic parameters showed that graphene oxide stabilized PdCo nanoparticles have very high negative entropy (Delta S: -170.85 J mol(-1) K-1) value and a low activation energy value (Ea: 17.53 +/- 2 kJ mol(-1) for the model reaction.

TI  - MoS2 confined on graphene by triethanolamine for enhancing electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The reduction of active sites due to reunion and slow electron transfer rates and low electronegativity greatly reduced the catalytic performance of many two-dimensional materials. In this paper, we synthesized composites for partially reducing graphene oxide and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2@prGO) by one-step hydrothermal method. With the addition of triethanolamine, MoS2 is highly dispersed on the prGO carrier and converted into the 1T phase MoS2 (50.4%). Meanwhile, it helps to increase the electron transfer rate of the MoS2@prGO composites. MoS2@prGO composites presents a high electron cloud density due to the existence of N atoms and prGO, which promotes the occurrence of hydrogen ion conversion hydrogen reaction and decreases the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution overpotential. MoS2@prGO composites exhibits an overpotential of 263 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) and a small Tafel slope of 60 mV/dec. This work is devoted to offer a new prospect and direction for the improvement of electrochemical HER performance. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, Graphene/alpha-MnO2 nanocomposite cathodes were produced using ultra-sonication and mechanical alloying facilities. Before production of Graphene/alpha-MnO2 composites, Graphene structure was fabricated by reduction of Graphene Oxide produced using Hummer's Method and alpha-MnO2 nanowires was synthesized using microwave hydrothermal synthesis method. The effect of Graphene support on the electrochemical performance of the Graphene/alpha-MnO2 nanocomposite cathodes were investigated by dispersing different amounts of Graphene (10 wt.%, 30 wt.% and 50 wt.%) in the composite cathodes. Structures of the Graphene/alpha-MnO2 nanocomposites were characterized using Xray diffraction (XRD) and Raman Spectroscopy techniques. Surface morphology of the electrodes was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Electrochemical cycling tests of the Graphene/alpha-MnO2 nanocomposite cathodes were performed in the voltage range of 1.5 V-4.5 V at a constant current density of 50 mA/g (C/5). This study proved that Graphene enhance the electrochemical reaction of alpha-MnO2 and provide stable cathode materials. Eventually, Graphene/alpha-MnO2 cathode containing 50 wt.% Graphene showed 225 mAh/g discharge capacity even after 200 cycles. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

TI  - Ternary Al-Mg-Ag alloy promoted palladium nanoparticles as potential catalyst for enhanced electro-oxidation of ethanol
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this report, ternary Al-Mg-Ag alloy is introduced as novel support material as well as active promoter for palladium nano catalyst. The catalytic activity is explored with respect to ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) in alkali. Pd nanoparticles supported on Al-Mg-Ag alloy is synthesized using a facile rapid solidification of melt method followed by chemical reduction. X-ray diffraction and microscopic analysis revealed uniformly distributed spherical Pd particle of nano dimension is formed on the support material. The application of the prepared catalysts for electro-chemical oxidation of ethanol is assessed by cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry (CA) and impedance spectroscopy (EIS) study. Pd/Al-Mg-Ag catalyst show remarkably high peak current density (1971 mA mg(pd)(-1)) for EOR which is 3.36 times higher than commercial Pd/C (20%) catalyst. In addition, the synthesized catalyst show low onset potential and excellent stability towards long-term application as anode catalyst for fuel cells. The study portrays Al-Mg-Ag trimetallic alloy as a promising support material and an effective promoter. The boosted catalytic activity may be attributed to the high dispersion, high Pd utilization, synergy between metals and superior conduction between support material and Pd nanoparticles.

AB  - Nitrogen doping could effectively enhance the catalytical activity of graphene-supported Pt nano-electrocatalysts for methanol oxidation reaction. Previously, the main strategy to the synthesis of Pt/N-graphene is the two-step reaction while it involves the complicated synthesis. In this work, we describe a facile and simple one-pot reaction including the reduction of graphene oxide, nitrogen doping of graphene, and uniform deposition of Pt nanoparticles on doped graphene. Compared with the Pt/graphene catalyst without nitrogen-doping, Pt/N-graphene exhibits excellent activity and durability towards methanol oxidation reaction, which is mainly ascribed to the contribution of the improved dispersion of Pt nanoparticles and the enhanced interaction between it and nitrogen-doped graphene. It is expected that this facile, green and economic single-step synthesis approach for the Pt/N-graphene electrocatalyst could be widely utilized to the nitrogen-doped graphene catalysts.

TI  - Palladium nanoparticles supported on chemically derived graphene: An efficient and reusable catalyst for the dehydrogenation of ammonia borane
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Chemically derived graphene (CDG) was prepared by hydrazine hydrate reduction of graphene oxide and used as support for palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) generated ex situ with controllable particle size and dispersion. The Pd NPs supported on CDG were well characterized by using a combination of advance analytical techniques and employed as catalyst in the dehydrogenation and hydrolysis of ammonia borane (AB) in organic solvents and aqueous solutions, respectively. Monodisperse Pd NPs of 4.5 nm were prepared from the reduction of palladium(II) acetylacetonate by tert-butylamine borane in the presence of oleylamine. They were readily impregnated on CDG which. has BET surface area of 500 m(2) g(-1). Pd NPs retain their particle size dispersion and stability when supported on chemically derived graphene. The resulting materials are highly active and stable catalyst for the dehydrogenation and hydrolysis of AB. In addition to their high activity and stability, these Pd NPs are also reusable catalyst in both dehydrogenation and hydrolysis of AB preserving 85% and 95% of initial activity after 5th and 10th runs, respectively.

TI  - Sonochemical synthesis of novel decorated graphene nanosheets with amine functional Cu-terephthalate MOF for hydrogen adsorption: Effect of ultrasound and graphene content
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel graphene oxide nanosheet (GO) decorated with functional Cu-terephthalate (Cu-BDC-NH2) metal-organic framework (MOF) designed for hydrogen adsorption and storage. The composite framework was produced under low-frequency high-power ultrasound (20 kHz) waves to improve reaction time and yield. The obtained green powder was then characterized by SEM, XRD, FTIR, BET, and TGA analysis. Box-Behnken Design (BBD) was applied to optimize the reaction condition and GO content. Compared to pure MOF, our results revealed that the coupled effects of sonochemical synthesis and GO content improved both the production yield and hydrogen adsorption capacity of the composite framework. Also, it was observed that ultrasound waves improve the solvent exchange process for framework activation. Besides, the incorporation of GO enhances the chemical and thermal stability of the Cu-BDC-NH2 framework. The ultrasound wave and GO content increased the hydrogen adsorption capacity by improving the BET surface area, more active sites population and decreasing gas diffusion resistance by creating more defects.

TI  - Orientated graphene oxide/Nafion ultra-thin layer coated composite membranes for vanadium redox flow battery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Graphene oxide (GO)/Nafion composite membranes, with orientated GO nanosheets in parallel to the surface of the ultra-thin coating layer (400-440 nm), are prepared by spin coating method and evidenced by electron microscopy analysis. Orientation of GO maximizes the vanadium ions barrier effect of GO. The GO/Nafion membrane (M-2) achieves lower vanadium ion permeability (8.2 x 10(-8) cm(2) min(-1), only 2.64% of the pristine Nafion membrane), and higher coulombic efficiency and energy efficiency (92.9-98.8% and 81.588.4%, respectively) comparing with the pristine Nafion membrane (73.3-90.5% and 68.979.1%, respectively) at current densities of 20-100 mA cm(-2). With the design of orientated GO nanosheets and ultra-thin GO/Nafion coating layer, good balance between vanadium crossover suppression and protons conduction retention is achieved. M-2 exhibits excellent battery performances over 200 charge-discharge cycles. The capacity decay rate is about 0.23% per cycle, much lower than those assembled with Nafion 212 (0.40% per cycle) and the recast Nafion membrane (0.44% per cycle). Spin coating with water suspensor leads to uniform dispersion of GO and good binding between GO/Nafion coating layer and substrate Nafion membrane. Therefore, the composite membrane could be reinforced by GO and keep integration even with 200 cycles operation. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study investigated the abilities of photocatalytic H-2 production by Ni-doped ZnS-graphene composite photocatalysts. Undoped or Ni-doped ZnS was loaded on the surface of graphene to prepare a series of composite photocatalysts. Properties of the photocatalysts were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscope (PESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), ultraviolet visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), photoinduced current, and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution test. The as-prepared graphene@Ni-doped ZnS nanocomposites are highly active photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution and the highest photocatalytic activity reaches 8683 umol h(-1) g(-1). Effects of introducing graphene, doping, and decorated ZnS on the surface chemistry, crystalline property, optical property, surface morphology, and photocatalytic hydrogen production performance were studied. Ni-doping and decorated ZnS on graphene improved the photocatalytic H-2 production activity because of improved dispersing property, increased surface area, increased absorption, and enhanced transfer of photogenerated electrons.

TI  - Carbon nanotubes supported platinum-gold alloy nanocrystals composites with ultrahigh activity for the formic acid oxidation reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Improving the electrocatalytic activity, durability, and utilization of anode eletrocatalysts are crucial for accelerating commercialization of direct formic acid fuel cells. In this work, the multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) supported PtAu alloy nanocrystals (MWCNTs/PtAu) composites are synthesized by a one-pot wet-chemical method using polyethyleneimine as the complexant and surfactant. The physicochemical properties of the as-prepared MWCNTs/PtAu composites are characterized detailedly by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, etc. These structural investigations display the PtAu alloy nanocrystals are highly dispersed on the surface of the MWCNTs. Cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry measurements show the as-prepared MWCNTs/PtAu composites significantly enhance the direct dehydrogenation pathway of the formic acid oxidation reaction, resulting in the improved electocatalytic activity and durability for the formic acid electrooxidation.

TI  - Novel quaternized carbon dots modified polysulfone-based anion exchange membranes with improved performance
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - At present, low conductivity and poor chemical stability are still the biggest challenges in the research on anion exchange membranes (AEMs). Herein, novel nanocomposite AEMs were first constructed by introducing quaternized carbon dots (QCDs) into the imidized polysulfone matrix (Im-PSU). QCDs were synthesized by quaternization of CDs derived from citric acid and ethylenediamine. The physicochemical properties and electrochemical properties of the nanocomposite AEMs were significantly improved due to the introduction of QCDs. It was found that the QCDs can improve the ion transport channel of the nano composite AEMs. Compared with pure Im-PSU AEM, the OH- conductivity and physicochemical properties of the nanocomposite membranes were enhanced, and the OH conductivity of ImPSU-1.0%-QCDs composite membrane can reach 109.3 mS cm(-1) at 80 degrees C, and 61.2% initial OH- conductivity was maintained in 1.0 M NaOH solution for 500 h at 60 degrees C. Our research proves that the nanofiller with a small size can better improve the performance of composite AEMs, and provide an efficient strategy for future research work in the design and preparation of AEMs. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Advanced Pd-based nanomaterials for electro-catalytic oxygen reduction in fuel cells: A review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Devising cost-effective and high-performance nanocatalysts for the inherently slow oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) represents a critical hurdle in the commercial improvement of fuel cells for energy conversion. Recently, considerable attempts have concentrated on exploring Pd-based nanocatalysts with advanced stability to utilize as substitutes for Pt. In this review, we first describe ORR mechanisms and summarize research conducted with Pd electro-catalysts, including single and alloyed Pd nanostructures on different substrates. The application of Pd catalysts as cathode nanomaterials in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs), and anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) is also reviewed. The insights into the connections between catalytic performance, structure, and preparation process are addressed. In particular, approaches for fabricating efficient Pd electro-catalysts, such as increasing the number of reactive centers and modifying nanoparticle-support interactions, are discussed. Challenges and prospects for upcoming investigations in developing desirable ORR nanocatalysts are highlighted.(c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Synergistic catalysis of Pd-Ni(OH)(2) hybrid anchored on porous carbon for hydrogen evolution from the dehydrogenation of formic acid
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of a facile yet efficient strategy to boost the catalytic performance of supported Pd nanoparticles (NPs) toward the dehydrogenation of formic acid (FA) is essential but remains challenging. Here, a novel hybrid nanocatalyst comprising Pd and Ni(OH)(2) supported on porous carbon (PC) is developed. The obtained Pd-Ni(OH)(2)/PC nanocatalyst exhibits an excellent catalytic performance for FA dehydrogenation to produce hydrogen. The introduction of Ni(OH)(2) in PC support can significantly promote the catalytic activity of Pd NPs toward FA dehydrogenation. Additionally, the catalytic property of Pd-Ni(OH)(2) /PC is correlated with the Pd/Ni ratio. The Pd-2-Ni-1(OH)(2)/PC with the optimum Pd/Ni ratio of 2/1 exhibits the maximum turnover frequency (TOF) of 3409 h(-1) at 60 degrees C for FA dehydrogenation. The highly dispersed ultrafine Pd-Ni(OH)(2) hybrid NPs with numerous accessible active sites and Ni(OH)(2)-induced positive synergetic effects with Pd NPs considerably boost the catalytic performance for FA dehydrogenation.

TI  - Composite proton conducting membranes from chitosan, poly(vinyl alcohol) and sulfonic acid-functionalized silica nanoparticles
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Composite proton conducting membranes were successfully synthesized from chitosan, poly (vinyl alcohol) and sulfonic acid-functionalized silica nanoparticles. Sulfosuccinic acid (SSA) and glutaraldehyde were used as double crosslinking agents, where the effect of SSA content on membrane properties, including water vapor absorption, water uptake, ion exchange capacity, and proton conductivity was investigated and were found to increase as a function of SSA loading. The most promising membrane was then formed into a composite with either silica nanoparticles containing poly (2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid) (PAMPS-Si) or poly (styrene sulfonic acid) (PSSA-Si). PAMPS-Si and PSSA-Si were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The effects of nanoparticle loading and polymer shell on membrane properties were studied. Proton conductivity increased at higher nanoparticle loadings, and reached a maximum of 3.8-3.9 x 10(-3) S/cm at 20% loading. The influence of polymer shell on membrane properties was not significantly observed. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Palladium(0) nanoparticles supported on ceria: Highly active and reusable catalyst in hydrogen generation from the hydrolysis of ammonia borane
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Palladium(0) nanoparticles supported on nanoceria (Pd-0/CeO2) were prepared by the impregnation of palladium(II) ions on the surface of ceria followed by their reduction with sodium borohydride in aqueous solution at room temperature. Pd-0/CeO2 were isolated from the reaction solution by centrifugation and characterized by ICP-OES, XRD, TEM, SEM-EDS and XPS techniques. All the results reveal that palladium(0) nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed on ceria and the resulting Pd-0/CeO2 are highly active and reusable catalysts in hydrogen generation from the hydrolysis of ammonia borane with a turnover frequency value of 29 min(-1) at 25.0 +/- 0.1 degrees C. The catalytic activity of Pd-0/CeO2 in hydrogen generation from the hydrolysis of ammonia borane is higher compared to that of other palladium based catalysts such as Pd-0/ZrO2, Pd-0/SiO2, Pd-0/Al2O3, Pd-0/TiO2 under the same conditions. The catalytic activity of Pd-0/CeO2 samples with various palladium loading in the range of 1.0-5.0% wt Pd was tested in hydrogen generation from the hydrolysis of ammonia borane at 25.0 +/- 0.1 degrees C. The highest catalytic activity was achieved by using 1.18% wt palladium loaded ceria. The reusability tests reveal that Pd-0/CeO2 are still active in the subsequent runs of hydrolysis of ammonia borane preserving 47% of the initial catalytic activity even after the fifth run of hydrolysis. Our report also includes the results of kinetic study of the catalytic hydrolysis of ammonia borane depending on the temperature and catalyst concentration. (c) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Metal link: A strategy to combine graphene and titanium dioxide for enhanced hydrogen production
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This communication addresses the key issues of titanium dioxide (TiO2) for hydrogen production through water splitting: wide band gap, low conductivity and large over potential, through a novel strategy metal links, which connect TiO2 and graphene to form a ternary junction (TiO2/Ag graphene). Silver (Ag) nanoparticles are identified as an excellent link and successfully deposited on TiO2, not only collecting and transferring photo-excited electrons from TiO2 to graphene, but also harvesting more photons through the effect of surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Such TiO2/Ag@graphene junctions improve the hydrogen production rate by three times with respect to the original TiO2. It is expected that the concept of metal links can be employed as a general approach to improve the performance of semiconductor-based photocatalysts. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Chitosan/graphene complex membrane for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell: A molecular dynamics simulation study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Chitosan has been considered attractive in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) due to its excellent film forming and fuel barrier properties. Reflecting the limitation of its low proton conductivity, various materials were used to improve the proton conductivity of chitosan, through combination with inorganic materials like graphene oxide. We present an ideal molecular model for bio-nanocomposites and their mechanism of proton conductivity in PEMFCs. In this study, the diffusion behavior of hydronium ions in chitosan/graphene complex systems at various temperatures, concentrations and pH values were studied systematically using 3 ns long molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with an aim to provide the mechanisms of proton conductivity of chitosan/graphene composite at an atomistic scale. Various amounts of water content (10%, 20%, 30% and 40%), pH values (achieved by adjusting the protonation degree of amino groups of chitosan by 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100%) and numbers of graphene sheets (1, 2, and 3) were considered during MD simulations at 4 temperatures (298 K, 320 K, 340 K and 360 K). Our results indicated that the chitosan system containing 40% water was the most suitable polymer electrolyte membrane and temperature was a key factor affecting diffusion proton. Adding graphene to the chitosan system and adjusting the pH values of chitosan were demonstrated to have a significant effect on improving the proton conductivity of the membrane.

AB  - Cost-effective non-noble metal catalysts are of key significance to the successful use of direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) for electricity generation. Herein, cuprous oxide nano particles (Cu2O NPs) supported graphene oxide (GO), polypyrrole (PPy) and polypyrrole-graphene oxide (PPy-GO) matrices were prepared using borohydride reduction method. The prepared catalysts were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV-Vis spectra, Zeta potential and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The elemental analysis of the composites was done by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Cu2O NPs were homogeneously dispersed and strongly anchored on the PPy grafted GO matrix and this was examined through morphological analysis. The Cu2O/PPy-GO (80:10:10) NPs exhibited noticeable improvement in electrochemical performance in comparison to pure graphene oxide (GO) and pure PPy supported Cu2O NPs catalyst and revealed the peak current density of 300 mu A cm(-2) at +0.68 V. The Cu2O/PPy-GO system demonstrated higher current density and also exhibited greater stability in comparison to the commercial Pt-Ru/C catalyst as characterized by chronoamperometry (CA) analysis. This prospective nano-catalyst showed higher I-F/I-B ratio (26%, 8.6% and 19%) compared to the corresponding catalyst systems of Cu2O/GO, Cu2O/PPy and Pt-Ru/C. In direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC), the efficiency of Cu2O/PPy-GO nano-catalyst system as an anode catalyst for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) was investigated and the result revealed a maximum current density of 155 mA cm(-2) at +0.2 V and power density of 31 mW cm(-2). Hence, Cu2O/PPy-GO NPs are a cost-effective alternative for Pt-Ru/C system to execute practical application in DMFC. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Highly stabilized Ag2O-loaded nano TiO2 for hydrogen production from glycerol: Water mixtures under solar light irradiation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nano TiO2 prepared by a hydrothermal method and silver-loaded nano TiO2 prepared by impregnation were studied for the photocatalytic production of hydrogen from glycerol: water mixtures. The structural characteristics were revealed using XRD, EDAX, DRS, TEM, XPS, BET surface area and Raman techniques. The photocatalytic hydrogen production has been investigated under solar light irradiation. Effects of nano TiO2 calcination temperature, silver loading, photocatalyst content, light source and Ag oxidation state on hydrogen production have been systematically studied. Maximum hydrogen production of 200 mol h(-1) g(-1) is observed on 4wt% silver-loaded nano TiO2 catalyst in pure water and the maximum hydrogen production of 7030 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) is observed on 3wt% silver-loaded nano TiO2 catalyst in glycerol: water mixtures. Silver-loaded nano TiO2 reduced and photodeposited catalysts show similar hydrogen production activities in glycerol: water mixtures under solar irradiation. The optimum catalyst modified with conducting carbon materials (graphene oxide, graphene, carbon nanotubes) by a solid-state dispersion method were also studied for hydrogen production under solar light irradiation. Compared with pure nano TiO2, a 3wt% silver-loaded nano TiO2/graphene composite exhibited an approximately 17-fold enhancement of hydrogen production leading to hydrogen production rates of 12,100 mu mol h(-1) g(-1). Based on the characterization results and hydrogen production activity on these catalysts, a structure-activity correlation has been proposed wherein the interacting Ag2O-Ag phases on the surface of nano TiO2 play an important role in maintaining a high hydrogen production activity under solar irradiation.

TI  - Transition metal dichalcogenide-based composites for hydrogen production
T2  - FUNCTIONAL COMPOSITES AND STRUCTURES
M3  - Review
AB  - Photocatalytic and electrocatalytic water splitting has emerged as a promising alternative for generating power from renewable resources. However, the widespread use of this method has been limited owing to the low efficiency of existing materials. Recently, two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been attracting researchers' attention owing to their unique optical and electronic properties. Studies have also shown that the hybridization of TMDs with different nanomaterials, such as metals, oxides, and carbon materials, can improve their catalytic activity toward hydrogen production. In this review, different types of TMD-based composites in photocatalytic and electrocatalytic water splitting are discussed.

TI  - Air-mediated construction of O, N-rich carbon: An efficient support of palladium nanoparticles toward catalytic formic acid dehydrogenation and 4-nitrophenol reduction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Oxygen and nitrogen-rich functional groups which are generally present in carbon materials may significantly affect their catalytic properties. The development of O, N-rich functional carbon materials with a simplified and low-budget strategy is of great importance for practical application. Herein, we describe a facile and straightforward method to prepare high contents of nitrogen and oxygen-rich carbon derived from ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid tetra-sodium salt (Na(4)EDTA) by one-step carbonization in muffle furnace without inert gas protection. Compared with the carbon (EC-N700) synthesized in an argon atmosphere, the carbon (EC-A700) synthesized in an air-rich condition was more conducive to the formation of edge defects and topological defects and possessed higher contents of N and O elements. Consequently, the O, N-rich carbon EC-A700 was used as an efficient support of palladium nanoparticles toward catalytic formic acid dehydrogenation and nitroarene reduction. The catalyst Pd/EC-A700 achieved outstanding activity for formic acid dehydrogenation with a turnover frequency (TOF) up to 7039 h(-1) at 60 degrees C. At the same time, the obtained catalyst Pd/EC-A700 also demonstrated exceptional catalytic performance in the 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) reduction with corresponding rate constant k of 0.72 min(-1) under mild reaction conditions, which proved that the prepared catalyst Pd/ECA-700 has potentially applied in catalytic hydrogenation. This low-cost and simple approach breaks the tradition in mind that pyrolysis should always operate under inert conditions and provides a straightforward route to construct O, N-rich carbon as appealing materials for a wide variety of applications.

AB  - Flower-like graphene (FG) prepared by a transformer coupled plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition method was used as support for the preparation of composite photo catalysts. Small ZnS particles were formed on the surface of FG by a hydrothermal process with ZnCl2 and Na2S precursors. The surface morphology, surface area, surface chemistry, crystalline property, optical properties, photogenerated current and photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of the FG-ZnS photocatalysts were investigated by using the X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectra, photocurrent response, photoluminescence spectra, electrochemical impedance spectra and photo catalytic hydrogen production tests. The maximum hydrogen production rate of FG-ZnS composite photocatalyst ZS-G0.02 was 11600 mu mol g(-1)h(-1) under UV light irradiation at a graphene/ZnCl2 precursor weight ratio of 0.02. The flower-like structure of FG may help the light absorption, adsorption of sacrificing agents in the solution, and separation of photogenerated carriers. In comparison with pristine ZnS photocatalyst, the FG-ZnS nano composites exhibits enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production activity. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Platinum nanoparticles deposited nitrogen-doped carbon nanofiber derived from bacterial cellulose for hydrogen evolution reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The nitrogen-doped carbon nanofiber derived from low and high proportion polyaniline doped bacterial cellulose (BC) was obtained via polymerization followed by pyrolysis. The resulting products were named LN-BC and HN-BC accordingly. Platinum nanoparticles modified LN-BC and HN-BC was then prepared (PORN-BC and Pt@HN-BC) via electrochemical deposition. The morphologies of LN-BC and HN-BC indicated that the BC lost its nanowire structure after polyaniline modification and pyrolysis under nitrogen atmosphere. Platinum nanoparticles with diameters ranging from 3 to 5 nm can be well dispersed in the HN-BC support. The HER performance of Pt@LN-BC and Pt@HN-BC was fully investigated. Electrochemical results showed that the Pt-based catalysts had better HER activity than the Pt free catalysts in acid, indicating the HER activity was mainly from Pt. Besides, Pt@HN-BC had better HER activity than Pt@LN-BC in acid, suggesting N-doping rate was an important factor in enhancing HER activity. And the 10Pt@HN-BC (deposition for 10 s) with 4.38 wt% Pt loading was the best HER catalyst among the Pt@HN-BC. The onset potential (@ -1 mA cm(-2)) and overpotential (@ -10 mA cm(-2)) of the 10Pt@HN-BC in 0.5 M H2SO4 is -18 and -47 mV, respectively. The corresponding Tafel slope was -35 mV dec(-1), which is quite comparable to that of Pt/C (10 wt%). The electrochemical double layer capacitance (C-dl) and turnover frequency (TOF) were estimated and presented in the work. Long-term stability test confirmed that the 10PtCHN-BC had excellent stability, which was important for practical application. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Bismuth oxycarbonate Nanoplates@alpha-Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets 2D plate-on-sheet heterostructure as electrode for high-performance supercapacitor
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the development of better-architectures in nanomaterials for energy storage devices, heterostructures have played an important role. In this paper, we have reported a new class of nanocomposite with two-dimensional plate-on-sheet heterostructure Bi2O2CO3 nanoplates@alpha-Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets (BCNP@NHNS) based nanocomposite was synthesized via a simple one-pot hydrothermal approach. The fabricated BCNP@ NHNS plate-on-sheet heterostructure exhibit better cyclic performance with higher specific capacitance than those of pristine Bi2O2CO3 and alpha-Ni(OH)(2). The optimized electrodes delivered a high specific capacity up to 743 F g(-1) at an applied current density of 3 A g(-1). Further, fabricated two-electrode symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) with KOH aqueous electrolyte delivered an energy density of 73.7 Wh kg(-1) coupled with a power density of 872.7 W kg(-1) and high capacitance of 725 F g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1). The retention of specific capacity up to 92.8% was achieved after 5000 cycles. The superior performance of BCNP@NHNS nanocomposite as a potential electrode material for supercapacitors with long cycling life is owed to the synergetic effect of the heterostructure in the nanocomposite.

AB  - Addressed herein, we reported the fabrication of the graphene oxide (GO) supported monodispersed ruthenium-platinum-nickel (RuPtNi) nanomaterials (3.40 +/- 0.32 nm) to be utilized as a catalyst in the process of dimethylamine borane (DMAB) dehydrogenation. The nanoparticles were fabricated through the ultrasonication method by co-reducing the Ru3+, Pt2+ and Ni2+ cations and then the nanomaterials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The fabricated nanomaterials showed outstanding efficiency and remarkable reusability in addition to their record catalytic activity at low temperatures and with extreme low concentrations. They had a significantly high turnover frequency (TOF) (727 h(-1)) and low activation energy (E-a) (49.43 +/- 2 kJ mol(-1)) for DMAB dehydrocoupling. To the best of our knowledge, RuPtNi@GO NPs become a very promising candidate as the best catalyst ever. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Highly sensitive platinum nanoparticles-embedded porous graphene sensor for monitoring ROS from living cells upon oxidative stress
T2  - SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Real-time monitoring reactive oxygen species (ROS) released from living cells is important in both physiological and pathological contexts. The excessive amount of ROS accumulation in cells could lead to a series of cell damage and cause aging and disease. Here we present design, fabrication, and successful testing of a highly sensitive electrochemical hydrogen peroxide sensor based on a three-dimensional (3D) platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) decorated porous graphene composite. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) investigations indicate that PtNPs were embedded into porous graphene (PGN), something that was rarely reported. With the help of the excellent catalytic activity of PtNPs and unique porous structure in combination with inherent properties of graphene, the PtNPs/PGN based sensor presents efficient electrochemical performance for H2O2 sensing with a detection limit of 0.02 nM, the lowest detection limit achieved in nonenzymatic electrochemical sensors so far, which guarantees the possibility of sensitive and reliable detection of H2O2 release from living cells. This work opens a new avenue for direct preparation of metal nanoparticle-embedded porous graphene composite. More importantly, the presented sensors can be successfully used for monitoring changes of H2O2 levels upon different stimuli and collecting kinetic information on cellular ROS release, which provides more opportunities to study its cellular biochemistry.

TI  - Growth of iron diselenide nanorods on graphene oxide nanosheets as advanced electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Advanced electrocatalysts for the fabrication of sustainable hydrogen from water splitting are innermost to energy research. Herein, we report the growth of iron diselenide (FeSe2) nanorods on graphene oxide (GO) sheets using two-step process viz., simple hydrothermal reduction and followed by wet chemical process. The orthorhombic phase of FeSe2 incorporated GO nanosheet was developed as a low-cost and efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by water splitting. The phase purity, crystalline structure, surface morphology and elemental composition of the synthesized samples have been investigated by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy (UV-vis), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS). Voltammetry and Tafel polarization methods have been utilized to assess the performance of various weight ratio of GO nanosheet in FeSe2 nanorods towards H-2 evolution. Detailed electrochemical investigations revealed that the 30% FeSe2/GO composite showed a tremendous electro-catalytic HER activity in acidic medium with high cathodic current density of 9.68 mA/cm(2) at eta = 250 mV overpotential and with a Tafel slope of 64 mV/dec. The 30% FeSe2/GO composite offers a high synergistic effect towards HER activity, which is mainly due to high electrochemical active catalytic sites, low charge-transfer resistance and enhanced electrocatalytic performances of H-2 production. The present analysis revealed the possible application of FeSe2/GO composite as a promising low-cost alternative to platinum based electrocatalysts for H2 production.

TI  - In-situ construction of graphene oxide in microsphere ZnS photocatalyst for high-performance photochemical hydrogen generation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploring high-efficiency photocatalysts for hydrogen generation from water splitting has recently spurred enormous scientific interest. Herein, the formation of Pt/GO-ZnS photocatalysts via a step-wise strategy and the mechanism of improved hydrogen production efficiency are systematically studied. Thus-prepared optimal Pt/GO-ZnS composite (with the ratio of Pt and GO are 1 and 2 wt%, respectively) exhibits excellent photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of 1082 mmol h(-1) g(-1) under simulated sunlight irradiation, which stays 2.8 and 2.6 times higher than that of ZnS/GO (2 wt%) and ZnS/Pt (1 wt%), respectively. Exhaustive experimental studies reveal that the outstanding activity of Pt/GO-ZnS is attributed to the efficient interfacial charge transfer and enhanced visible light harvesting caused by the synergetic effects of GO and Pt. In further contexts, the photocatalytic mechanism is explored: Photo-generated electrons in the conduction band of ZnS can be immediately trapped through GO and rapidly transferred onto Pt nanoparticles thanks to the tight interface. This study represents an effective and facile strategy to rationally design advanced photocatalytic system in solar energy conversion. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Effect of rGO on Fe2O3-TiO2 composite incorporated NiP coating for boosting hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline solution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fe2O3-TiO2 composite incorporated NiP coating is a known promising catalytic coating for electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER). It is explored in the present study that the activity of the coating can be enhanced by incorporation of rGO. The Fe2O3-TiO2/rGO, electrocatalyst is synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method. Various compositions of the Fe2O3-TiO2/rGO incorporated NiP coatings on mild steel substrate are developed by a chemical reduction method. The developed Fe2O3-TiO2/rGO composite coating exhibits effective hydrogen evolution reaction activity with a Tafel slope of 98 mV dec(-1) and a low overpotential of 96 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The hydrogen evolution reaction mechanism comprises of Volmer (adsorption of Hydrogen atom) followed by Heyrovskii (reduction to H-2). The enhanced catalytic activity by the incorporation of rGO into the coating is due to three dimensional projections of nano Fe2O3-TiO2 on the folded surface of rGO. It effectively enhances the electrochemically active surface area of the coated electrode. The electrode is highly stable during alkaline HER. These results reveal that Fe2O3-TiO2/rGO can be treated as an effective electrocatalyst during HER from alkaline solutions. The conclusions pave the way for exploration of new similar catalysts for other applications. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Herein we report on various surface morphological characteristics of the synthesized cobalt oxide (Co3O4) nanostructures obtained by means of facile one-step hydrothermal method for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The synthesized nanostructures of Co3O4 were adequately characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) fitted with Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) elemental mapping, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman techniques. The electrochemical studies were carried out to analyse the performance of as-synthesized catalysts for ORR by cyclic voltammetry (CV), and chronoamperometric (CA) techniques. A higher electrocatalytic response was observed for Co3O4 nanocubes compared with all the other controlled electrodes by CV with a current density of 0.69 mA/cm(2) at a potential value of -0.46 V. The as-synthesized material showed adequate tolerance against methanol observed by CV in the presence of 0.5 M methanol, and good stability when compared with commercial Pt/C catalyst using the CA technique.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Different binary PtxPd1-x alloys supported on Vulcan carbon XC-72R were synthesized by the displacement of ligands from organometallic compounds to be used as anodic electrode for methanol electro-oxidation in alkaline medium. The influence of the Pd addition during the synthesis of PtxPd1-x alloys in presence of octylamine as stabilizer was analyzed in terms of structure, chemical composition and electroactivity in the methanol oxidation reaction. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis showed that the surface of the electrodes consisted of a metallic mixture and oxide states, which confirmed the change in the electronic properties during the alloy formation. The current density of Pt30Pd70/C during CV measurements was about 2.1 times higher than the one observed with Pt/C electrodes. The CO tolerance was also slightly improved under similar conditions. The work findings indicate that stabilized Pt30Pd70/C binary alloys can be used to design highly active anodic catalysts with potential applications in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs).

AB  - Photocatalytic hydrogen production under the visible spectrum of solar light is an important topic of research. To achieve the targeted visible light hydrogen production and improve the charge carrier utilization, bandgap engineering and surface modification of the photocatalyst plays a vital role. Present work reports the one-pot synthesis of Cu TiO2/CuO nanocomposite photocatalyst using green surfactant -aided -ultrasonication method. The materials characterization data reveals the TiO2 particle size of 20-25 nm and the existence of copper in the lattice as well as in the surface of anatase TiO2. This is expected to facilitate better optical and surface properties. The optimized photocatalyst shows enhanced H-2 production rate of 10,453 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) of the catalyst which is 21 fold higher than pure TiO2 nanoparticles. The photocatalyst was tested for degradation of methylene blue dye (90% in 4 h) in aqueous solution and photocatalytic reduction of toxic Cr6+ ions (55% in 4 h) in aqueous solution. A plausible mechanistic pathway is also proposed. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The morphology, structure, and composition of the support material significantly affect the catalytic activity of the fuel cell catalyst. In this work, we report a systematic and comparative study of the effects of the support morphology for Pt-Ni nanoparticles for the ORR. The effect of the support morphology on the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction was investigated. Pt-Ni alloy catalysts were characterized using various physico-chemical techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Pt-Ni alloy nanoparticles were deposited uniformly on a graphene support and their oxygen reduction activities were evaluated in an acid electrolyte. The ORR activity of Pt-Ni supported on graphene was also compared with Pt-Ni supported on Vulcan carbon XC-72 and carbon nanotubes. The electrocatalytic activity and stability of Pt-Ni alloy catalysts were studied using cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry, rotating disk electrode, and rotating ring disk electrode techniques. The results demonstrate that the graphene supported Pt-Ni catalyst showed the highest ORR activity among the three evaluated catalysts. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

M3  - Review
AB  - With increasing attention on hydrogen (H-2) produced by renewable energy methods for transport and other applications, an updated evaluation of H-2 monitoring techniques is timely. The emergence of nanomaterials with unique properties enables a new class of H-2 sensing materials, exhibiting important attributes such as high surface area to volume ratio, reactivity and number of active sites. The development of these materials allows for improved H-2 sensing methods with increased sensitivity, selectivity, speed and improved economy for both financial cost and power consumption. These advances enable small-scale, high-performance H-2 sensors for use in emerging hybrid renewable energy systems, including Internet of Things (IoT) or mobile systems. While literature reports on H-2 sensors include thermal conductivity, resistive, optical, acoustic, electrochemical and catalytic methods, this review will focus on resistive H-2 sensing nanomaterials. Three classes of these nanomaterials are discussed: metal oxides, transition metal dichalcogenides, and graphene based nanomaterials. As a key aim of this review is improved economy of use, we will elaborate only sensors operating at temperatures lower than 200 degrees C, with a focus on potential for room temperature operation.

TI  - Fabrication of a Cu2-xSe/rGO heterojunction photocatalyst to achieve efficient photocatalytic H-2 generation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study has successfully fabricated a Cu2-xSe/rGO heterojunction for the first time using an in situ hot-injection method and employed it to produce photocatalytic hydrogen. The optimal Cu2-xSe/3%rGO can achieve an efficient photocatalytic H-2 production at the rate 3123.48 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), nearly 3.46 times higher than that of the pure Cu2-xSe. The enhanced activity can be attributed to facilitated light absorption, up-regulated charge density, lower interfacial transfer resistance as well as a longer electron decay lifetime. In the meantime, the expanded specific surface area can create more active reaction sites, leading to the enhancement of photocatalytic peropeties. Besides, the mechanism of the Cu2-xSe/rGO heterojunction's hydrogen production is proposed. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - One-step synthesis of nanoblocks@nanoballs NiMnO3/Ni6MnO8 nanocomposites as electrode material for supercapacitors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel nanoblocks@nanoballs NiMnO3/Ni6MnO8 electrode material was synthesized by one-step solvothermal hydrothermal method, followed by thermal annealing. At the same time, electrode materials with different nanostructure were prepared by changing the volume ratio of deionied water and ethylene glycol. The results show that different structure has been gained including nanospheres, nanosheets and nanoblocks. When the deionied water: ethylene glycol = 1:1 (nanoblocks@nanoballs NiMnO3/Ni6MnO8 composite structure), the electrode material has a maximum specific surface area of 55.3 m(2) g(-1). The electrode material exhibited outstanding electrochemical performance with specific capacitance reached 494.4 F g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1) as well as superior cycling performance of 88.0% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 3 A g(-1). Such excellent performance was due to the synergistic effective between the Ni6MnO8 nanoballs and NiMnO3 nanoblocks. Nanoballs structure will increase in specific surface area and redox reaction active sites, and the blocks structure acts as a holder to improved the cycle performance. The NiMnO3/Ni6MnO8 become a promising candidate as next-generation electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Facile one-step hydrothermal preparation of molybdenum disulfide/carbon composite for use in supercapacitor
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A mesoporous molybdenum disulfide/carbon (MoS2/C) composite with flower-like morphology resulting from the decoration of carbon by MoS2 interlaced nanosheets was synthesized by a facile hydrothermal route, and utilized for the electrode material of supercapacitor. The morphologies and structures of materials were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectrum and N-2 adsorption desorption isotherm. Electrochemical properties of materials were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests of two-electrode supercapacitors. The results indicate that the complex of carbon and MoS2 can increase the electrical conductivity and can get thinner MoS2 nanosheets leading to the increment of specific surface area, which result in the improvement in the electrochemical performances of material. The specific capacitance of MoS2/C composite reaches 201.4 F ri at a current density of 0.2 A cl in a two-electrode supercapacitor, which is higher than those of pure MoS2 and carbon. Additionally, the MoS2/C-based supercapacitor exhibits high rate capability and long cyclic durability. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Novel proton exchange membranes based on proton conductive sulfonated PAMPS/PSSA-TiO2 hybrid nanoparticles and sulfonated poly (ether ether ketone) for PEMFC
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nanocomposite membranes based on sulfonated poly (ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) and sulfonated core-shell TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared. TiO2 nanoparticles were sulfonated by redox polymerization method by using sodium styrene sulfonate (SSA) and 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propane sulfonic acid (AMPS) monomers. The resultant hybrid nanoparticles (PAMPS-gTiO(2) and PSSA-g-TiO2) were introduced to SPEEK with a sulfonation degree of 68%. Grafting of sulfonated polymers onto TiO2 nanoparticles enhanced the content of proton transport sites in the membrane, leading to an increase in proton conductivity and power density. Besides, the mechanical and dimensional stabilities of the nanocomposite membranes were also improved compared with pure SPEEK membrane. The maximum power density for membranes containing 7.5 wt% of PAMPS-gTiO(2) and PSSA-g-TiO2 nanoparticles at 80 degrees C obtained 283 mW cm(-2) and 245 mW cm(-2), respectively.

TI  - Controllable synthesis of PtPd nanocubes on graphene as advanced catalysts for ethanol oxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PtPd nanocubes (NCs) were uniformly deposited on the reduced graphene oxides (RGOs) via a one-pot solvothermal reduction. These PtPd NCs were enclosed with (100) facet. Their size can be tuned from 11 to 27 nm by controlling their composition. Under the optimum atomic ratio of Pt/Pd (1:5), the as-prepared RGO-supported PtPd NCs show a superior catalytic efficiency of ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) with a specific activity of 2.3 mA cm(-2) and a mass activity of 1.08 A mg(-1) Pt, far above those for the RGO-supported Pt nano particles (0.3 mA cm(-2) for specific activity and 0.018 A mg(-1) Pt for mass activity). Besides, these EOR catalysts exhibit a high CO-tolerance without significant current decay during steady-state polarization at 0.6 V over 4000 s. Their durability is also remarkable with only 8.9% loss of their electrochemical surface area (ECSA) after 10 000 cycles of voltammetric test. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB  - NiAl2O4/NiO nanostructures were synthesized via an auto-combustion method using green tea extract. TiO2, SiO2, and graphene were used in order to enhance the electrochemical hydrogen storage performance of NiAl2O4. The structural analysis of host texture confirmed the formation of NiO alongside with NiAl2O4. Furthermore, the formation of nanocomposites and distribution of the additives on the surface of NiAl2O4/NiO nanostructures were affirmed by XRD and EDS spectra. The morphological analyses were displayed the nanoscale formation of the particles. Interestingly, the electrochemical hydrogen storage of the nanocomposites indicated that upon addition of TiO2, SiO2 and graphene, the discharge capacity enhanced as compare to the host material. The maximum discharge capacities of NiAl2O4/NiO and its respective nanocomposites containing SiO2, graphene, and TiO2 were observed at 850, 2000, 2750 and 3000 mA h/g, respectively.

TI  - Ni-Fe nanocubes embedded with Pt nanoparticles for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Electrochemical water-splitting is widely regarded as one of the essential strategies to produce hydrogen energy, while Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) materials are used to prepare electrochemical catalysts because of its controllable morphology and low cost. Herein, a series of trimetallic porous Pt-inlaid Ni-Fe nanocubes (NCs) are developed with bifunctions of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In the process of prepare the electrochemical catalysts, Pt nanoparticles are uniformly embedded in the Fe-Ni PBA cube structure, and ascorbic acid is employed as a reducing agent to reduce Pt2+ to Pt nanoparticles. In this work, the cubic structure of Fe-Ni PBA is maintained and the noble metal Pt nanoparticles are embedded. Remarkably, the formation of PBA cubes, Pt inlay and reduction are completed in one step, and Pt nanoparticles are embedded by a simple method for the first time. By employing acid etching method, a porous structure is formed on the PBA cube, which increases the exposed area of the catalyst and provides more active sites for HER and OER. Due to the porous structure, highly electrochemical active surface area and the embedded of highly dispersed Pt nanoparticles, the porous 0.6 Ni-Fe-Pt nanocubes (NCs) exhibits excellently electrocatalytic performance and durable stability to HER and OER. In this work, for HER and OER, And Tafel slopes are 81 and 65 mV dec(-1), the overpotential n at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) are 463 and 333 mV, and the onset potential are 0.444 and 1.548 V, respectively. And after a 12-h i-t test and 1000 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV), it maintained high stability and durability. This work opens up a new preparation method for noble metal embedded MOF materials and provided a new idea for the preparation of carbon nanocomposites based on MOF.

TI  - Hydrogen storage mechanism in transition metal decorated graphene oxide: The symbiotic effect of oxygen groups and high layer spacing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Transition metal nanoparticle decoration is widely used to enhance the hydrogen storage properties of carbon materials. However, little efforts have been devoted to unveil structural interaction between nanoparticles and substrate and understand the underlying kinetic mechanism for hydrogen sorption. In this work, a suite of TiO2 nanoparticles decorated graphene oxide (GO) composites is fabricated and characterized to determine the interactions between material structure and hydrogen storage kinetics. EELS and XPS results show that interactions between nanoparticles and GO cause changes of the chemical states of C-O, C=O and C-OH groups; furthermore, reactions of C-OH, HO-C= O and C-O-C groups with TiO2 nanoparticles create C-Ti and Ti-O-C bonding. Decoration of TiO2 nanoparticles improves the capacity of GO by 2.3x, and 80% of the adsorption is reversible. By means of semi-empirical kinetic analysis, it is determined that hydrogen adsorption is controlled by two-dimensional diffusion regardless of layer spacing; while desorption is controlled by multiple diffusion processes and is sensitive to layer spacing. Collectively, these new findings deepen the understanding of transition metal nano particles decorated GO materials in the aspects of nanoparticle incorporation and hydrogen storage kinetic mechanism. In particular, oxygen groups enhance nanoparticle decoration, while high layer spacing improves desorption kinetics and reversibility. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB  - The insufficiency of clean water sources has become a perilous tension for the future of the world that one of the eco-friendly and cost-effective solutions is the photocatalytic process for removal of artificial dyes and poisonous organic impurities. In the current research, a simple sonochemistry process was accomplished to gain Er2Sn2O7 (ESO) nanoparticles with progressive photo-catalytic proficiency. Various surfactants of cationic Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB), anionic Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and polymeric poly-ethylene glycol 6000 (PEG 6000) were utilized to the creation of pure Er2Sn2O7 nanoparticles. The figure and dimension of products were studied by various characterization procedures of spectroscopic and microscopic. The photo-degradation performances of the pure Er2Sn2O7 nanoparticles prepared in different conditions were tested to remove of diverse synthetic dyes. Carbon-based nanocomposites of graphitic carbon nitrides (g-C3N4), gra-phene quantum dots (GQDs) and graphene oxide (GO) present enhanced photocatalytic activities. The outcome of the catalyst size, type of dye, kind of carbon structure and scavenger kind was labeled on modifying ability of Er-Sn-O nano-catalyst task. Optimized Er2Sn2O7/g-C3N4 nanocomposites have an efficiency of 93.9% for degradation of acid red dye that "OH radicals support photo-degradation of contamination.

TI  - Binderless, bendable graphene/FexSn1-xO2 anode for lithium-ion batteries without the necessity of a current collector
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - SnO2 is an appealing anode material for lithium ion batteries. Advantages of SnO2 includes relatively low charge-discharge plateau and highly abundance in nature. However, the volume change (300%) is significant and critically impeding its cycle life. In this manuscript, we address these problems by exploiting an in-situ redox process to prepare graphene encapsulated SnO2 nanoparticles using soluble Sn2+ as the Sn precursor, which is oxidized to SnO2 by using graphene oxide. This method affords graphene@ SnO2 via oxygen bridging through of SnO2 nanoparticles. Furthermore, this method incorporates Fe atom into the SnO2 structure in-situ to create FexSn1-xO2 structure, which exhibits higher Li storage capacity. Our synthetic approach delivers graphene encapsulated FexSn1-xO2 structure, which is located on flexible carbonaceous fibers, and the whole system can be applied as lithium-ion batteries anode without any need of a current collector or binder polymer. This novel Sn based electrode could deliver a high capacity (calculate total electrode mass) of 454.3 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 100 mA g(-1) (65.1% retention). Unlike most contemporary technologies, increasing the thickness of our Sn based electrode simply increases the capacity proportionally. The areal capacity is 1348.3 mu Ah cm(-2), and it is simply doubled to 2856.1 mu Ah cm(-2) while we double the thickness of electrode. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - One step electrodeposition of V2O5/polypyrrole/graphene oxide ternary nanocomposite for preparation of a high performance supercapacitor
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - new ternary nanocomposite based on graphene oxide (GO), polypyrrole (PPy) and vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) is obtained via one-step electrochemical deposition process. Electrochemical deposition of V2O5, PPy and GO on a stainless steel (SS) substrate is conducted from an aqueous solution containing vanadyl acetate, pyrrole and GO to get V2O5/ PPy/GO nanocomposite. Characterization of the electrode material is carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The electrochemical performance of the as-prepared nanocomposite is evaluated by different electrochemical methods including cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution. Remarkably, V2O5/PPy/GO nanocomposite shows a specific capacitance of 750 F g(-1) at a current density of 5 A g(-1), which is far better than PPy (59.5 F g(-1)), V2O5/PPy (81.5 F g(-1)) and PPy/GO (344.5 F g(-1)). Furthermore, V2O5/PPy/GO maintains 83% of its initial value after 3000 cycles, which demonstrates good electrochemical stability of the electrode during repeated cycling. These results demonstrate that the combination of electrical double layer capacitance of GO and pseudocapacitive behavior of the PPy and V2O5 can effectively increase the specific capacitance and cycling stability of the prepared electrode. Also, a symmetric supercapacitor device assembled by V2O5/PPy/GO nanocomposite yielded a maximum energy density of 27.6 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 3600 W kg(-1), and a maximum power density of 13680 W kg(-1) at an energy density of 22.8 W h kg(-1).

Here, graphene oxide guiding nickel and iron layered double hydroxides hybrid arrays (GO-FeNi-LDH) are firstly fabricated by one-step electro-deposition method. The pretty 3D arrays with sheets vertically growing on nickel foam (NF) are highlighted by controlling the quantity of GO. Furthermore, the electron transfer from Ni, Fe to graphene is detected, making the metals and graphene in high valence and electron-rich state, respectively. The optimal GO-FeNi-LDH presents pretty morphology, defects, electron interactions and good conductivity. Therefore, to achieve 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), it requires the overpotentials of 119, 210, 285 and 303 mV for HER and OER and excellent durability. Noticeably, the optimal GO-NiFe-LDH needs a cell voltage of 1.48 V to drive 10 mA cm(-2) for the whole water splitting, which are lower than that of most of advanced electrocatalysts, endowing it in first-rank electrocatalyst.

AB  - A series of efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst composed of nitrogen-doped graphene-cobalt oxide nanoparticles nano-hybrids (Co-N/G) are fabricated by one-pot hydrothermal synthesis, which involves in-situ growth of cobalt oxides nanocrystals and nitrogen doping into graphene. 2, 4, 6-Triaminopyrimidine used as nitrogen precursor could anchor cobalt oxides nanoparticles on graphene oxide as active centers for oxygen electrode reactions. The TEM, Raman, XRD and XPS confirm the germination of nitrogen doped graphene and nano-sized cobalt oxides. The optimized Co-N/G catalyst consists of the highest contents of pyridinic nitrogen and CoO, which efficiently catalyze both ORR and OER. The strong coupling between cobalt oxides and N-graphene endows Co-N/G 600 with a low reversible overvoltage of 0.96 V between ORR and OER in alkaline medium, which is superior to novel catalysts such as Pt/C (1.24 V), IrO2 (1.43 V) and RuO2 (1.35 V), rendering it bi-catalyst efficient and economical for reversible oxygen electrode reactions.

TI  - Sulfonated graphene oxide as an inorganic filler in promoting the properties of a polybenzimidazole membrane as a high temperature proton exchange membrane
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A commercial perfluorinated sulfonic acid (PFSA) membrane, Nafion, shows outstanding conductivity under conditions of a fully humidified surrounding. Nevertheless, the use of Nafion membranes that operate only at low temperature (<100 degrees C) can lead to some disadvantages in PEMFC systems, such as a low impurity tolerance and slow kinetics. To overcome the above problems, this study introduces a highly durable composite membrane with an inorganic filler for a high-temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (HT-PEMFC) applications under anhydrous conditions. In this work, polybenzimidazole (PBI) is used as a polymer electrolyte membrane with the addition of a sulfonated graphene oxide (SGO) inorganic filler. The amount of SGO filler was varied (0.5-6 wt.%) to study its influence on proton conductivity at elevated temperature, mechanical stability as well as phosphoric acid doping level. In particular, PBI-SGO composite membranes exhibited higher the level of acid dopant and proton conductivities than those of the pure PBI membranes. The PBI-SGO 2 wt.% composite membrane displayed the highest proton conductivity, with a value of 9.142 mS cm(-1) at 25 degrees C, and it increased to 29.30 mS cm(-1) at 150 degrees C. The PBI-SGO 2 wt.% also displayed the maximum values in the acid doping level (11.63 mol of PA/PBI repeat unit) and mechanical stability (48.86 MPa) analyses. In the HT-PEMFC test, compared with a pristine PBI membrane, the maximum power density was increased by 40% with the use of a PBI composite membrane with 2 wt.% SGO. These results show that the PBI-SGO membrane has a great potential to be applied as an alternative membrane in HT-PEMFC applications, offering the possibility of improving impurity tolerance and kinetic reactions.

AB  - Hydrogen sensor based on graphene nano-composite with Pd-Ag nanoparticles was fabricated by MEMS process. Structural and morphological properties of the sensing film were studied by an energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), respectively. The H-2 sensing properties of as-formed sensor were investigated by measuring the resistance changes at different H-2 concentrations. The maximum gas response was 16.2% at 1000 ppm of H-2 gas. The gas sensitivity of the as formed H-2 sensor showed linear behavior with the hydrogen concentration. Experimental results showed that the coupling of graphene with Pd/Ag alloy enhanced significantly hydrogen sensing performance. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Co, Ni-based nanoparticles supported on graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets as catalysts for hydrogen generation from the hydrolysis of ammonia borane under broad-spectrum light irradiation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - From the viewpoint of tailoring the atomic and nanoscale structures of semiconductors to enhance the solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion, we employed an in-situ gas template-assisted co-polymerization route, where melamine and 2,4,6-triaminopyrimidine were co-monomers and NH4Cl was the in-situ gas template, to synthesize porous broadspectrum light-responsive carbon nitride nanosheet (termed as CNN) species with increased pi-electron availability. Then we developed CNN-supported Co and Ni nanoparticles (NPs) for catalytic hydrogen generation from aqueous ammonia borane (NH3BH3) under light irradiation (lambda >= 420 nm) at room temperature. Though all the Co-based catalysts had the similar activities with total turnover frequency (TOF) values of 37.5-44.1 min(-1) in the dark, they exhibited significantly different and enhanced photocatalytic activities. Remarkably, the optimized catalyst had a total TOF value of 123.2 min(-1), exceeding the values of reported non-noble metal catalysts. Moreover, the porous CNN species possessed the C-substitution for N, tunable narrow bandgaps of 0.71-2.34 eV and efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers. This resulted in the enriched electron density of metal NPs and the apparent quantum yield of 66.9% at 420 nm. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - 3D ternary NixCo2-xP/C nanoflower/nanourchin arrays grown on HCNs: a highly efficient bi-functional electrocatalyst for boosting hydrogen productionviathe urea electro-oxidation reaction
T2  - NANOSCALE
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last few years, substantial efforts have been made to develop earth-abundant bi-functional catalysts for urea oxidation and energy-saving electrolytic hydrogen production due to their low cost and the potential to replace traditional noble-metal-based catalysts. Nevertheless, finding a straightforward and effective route to prepare efficient catalysts with unique structural features and optimal supports still is a big challenge. Among the various candidates, metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived materials show great advantages as new kinds of active non-precious catalysts. On the other hand, the controllable integration of MOFs and carbon-based nanomaterials leads to further enhancement in terms of the stability and electrical conductivity of catalysts. In this communication, we develop an MOF-carbon-based composite to synthesize a transition metal phosphide (TMP) catalyst for the electrocatalytic oxidation of urea. First, poly(pyrrole-co-aniline) (PPCA) hollow nanospheres were fabricatedviathein situemulsion polymerization of a mixture of aniline and pyrrole in the presence of Triton X-100. Then, the simple carbonization treatment of these PPCA hollow spheres led to the carbonized hollow carbon nanospheres (HCNs) with ultrahigh surface areas and uniform nano-morphologies. After that, bimetallic MM '/MOFs (M/M ' = Ni, Co) were uniformly grown around the HCNsviaa simple hydrothermal reaction (NiCo/MOF@HCNs). During the synthesis process, by adjusting Ni/Co ratios, the MOF morphology can be engineered so that by reducing the Ni/Co ratio, the flower-like structures change into urchin-like structures. Finally, this NiCo/MOF@HCNs precursor with different Ni/Co ratios during thein situcarbonization/phosphorization was chemically converted into Ni-Co mixed-metal phosphides (NixCo2-xP/C@HCNs). Finally, the electrocatalytic activity of the prepared catalysts was tested for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

AB  - Pd-Ag-Fe, Fe-Pd-Ag and Fe-Ag-Pd trimetallic nanoparticles were synthesized by seedless and step-wise simultaneous chemical reduction of Fe3+, Ag+ and Pd2+ by using hydrazine in presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and used as a catalyst for the degradation of formic acid. The effects of nanoparticle composition, presence of sodium format (promoter), [catalyst], [formic acid] and temperature play key roles in the hydrogen generation. The Ba(OH)(2) trap experiment and water displacement technique were used to determine the generation of CO2 and H-2, respectively. The decomposition of formic acid followed complex-order kinetics with respect to [formic acid]. It was found that Fe-Ag-Pd showed a maximum catalytic activity (turn over frequency) of 75 mol H-2 per mol catalyst per h. The activation energy (E-a = 51.6 kJ/mol), activation enthalpy (Delta H = 48.9 kJ/mol) and activation entropy (Delta S = 151.0 JK-1 moll were determined and discussed for the catalytic reaction. The reusability of the Fe-Ag-Pd at 50 degrees C shows an efficient degree of activity for six consecutive catalytic cycles. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Self-Limiting Growth of Single-Layer N-Doped Graphene Encapsulating Nickel Nanoparticles for Efficient Hydrogen Production
T2  - ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective nonprecious metal catalysts are urgently needed for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The hybridization of N-doped graphene and a cost-effective metal is expected to be a promising approach for enhanced HER performance but faces bottlenecks in controllable fabrication. Herein, a silica medium-assisted method is developed for the high-efficient synthesis of single-layer N-doped graphene encapsulating nickel nanoparticles (Ni@SNG), where silica nanosheets molecule sieves tactfully assist the self-limiting growth of single-layer graphene over Ni nano-particles by depressing the diffusion of gaseous carbon radical reactants. The Ni@SNG sample synthesized at 800 degrees C shows excellent activity for HER in alkaline medium with a low overpotential of 99.8 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which is close to that of the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst. Significantly, the Ni@SNG catalyst is also developed as a binder-free electrode in magnetic field, exhibiting much improved performance than the common Nafion binder-based electrode. Therefore, the magnetism adsorption technique will be a greatly promising approach to overcome the high electron resistance and poor adhesive stability of polymer binder-based electrodes in practical applications.

TI  - Fabrication of graphene/CaIn2O4 composites with enhanced photocatalytic activity from water under visible light irradiation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A series of graphene/CaIn2O4 composites were synthesized using a facile solvothermal method to improve the photocatalytic performance of CaIn2O4. The reduction of graphene oxide to graphene and the deposition of CaIn2O4 nanoparticles on the graphene sheets can be achieved simultaneously during the solvothermal process. The photocatalytic activities of as-prepared graphene/CaIn2O4 composites for hydrogen evolution from CH3OH/H2O solution were investigated under visible light irradiation. It was found that graphene exhibited an obvious influence on the photocatalytic activity of CaIn2O4. The graphene/CaIn2O4 composite reached a high H-2 evolution rate of 62.5 mu mol h(-1) from CH3OH/H2O solution when the content of graphene was 1 wt%. Furthermore, the 1 wt% graphene/ CaIn2O4 composite did not show deactivation for H2 evolution for longer than 32 h. This work could provide a new insight into the fabrication of visible light driven photocatalysts with efficient and stable performance. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

TI  - A novel visible-light responsive photocatalytic fuel cell with a highly efficient BiVO4/WO3 inverse opal photoanode and a MnO2/graphene oxide nanocomposite modified cathode
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A highly efficient inverse-opal structured BiVO4/WO3 photoanode and a MnO2/graphene oxide (GO) nanocomposite modified cathode were successfully synthesized in this paper. The optimized BiVO4/WO3 inverse opal photoanode achieved a photocurrent density of similar to 5.04 mA/cm(2) at 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl under simulated AM 1.5 illumination, which was 2.84 and 2.36 times higher than that of WO(3 )inverse opal photoanode and BiVO4/WO3 nanoflake photoanode, respectively. The BiVO4/WO3 inverse opal photoanode was coupled with the MnO2/GO modified cathode to build up a novel visible-light responsive photocatalytic fuel cell (PFC) system. The as-established PFC showed outstanding power production performances in comparison with the PFC equipped with a bare MnO2 modified cathode. For example, in the former PFC system, the maximum power density and the short circuit current density were similar to 66.2 mu W/cm(2) and similar to 593.5 mu/cm(2), respectively, for comparison, in the latter PFC, the values were similar to 30.1 mu W/cm(2) and similar to 255.9 mu A/cm(2), respectively. The degradation experiment for Rhodamine B confirmed successful application of the as-established PFC in pollutant degradation. The mechanism for the significantly enhanced photoelectrocatalytic performances of the PFC was elucidated. The PFC system presented in this paper opened up a new prototype in developing highly efficient devices for energy conversion and environmental protection. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Monodisperse Pt(0)/DPA@GO nanoparticles as highly active catalysts for alcohol oxidation and dehydrogenation of DMAB
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Addressed herein, monodisperse platinum nanoparticles (Pt (0)/DPA@GO NPs), supported on graphene oxide (GO), have been prepared by sonochemical double solvent reduction method by the help of dipropylamine (DPA) as a stabilizer at room temperature and used as a catalyst for both C-1 to C-3 alcohol oxidation reaction and the dehydrogenation of dimethylamine-borane ((CH3)(2)NHBH3) at room temperature. Monodisperse Pt (0)/DPA@GO NPs were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ICP-OES, and electrochemical measurements (CV). The catalytic performance of the monodisperse Pt NPs demonstrated that they were highly efficient and reusable catalysts even at low temperature for both methanol, ethanol and 2-propanol oxidations. The prepared nano particles can also catalyse the dehydrogenation of DMAB with very high activity (TOF = 35.82 h(-1)) at room temperature. The prepared monodisperse Pt (0)/DPA@GO NPs have similar to 11.6, 16.8 and 7.61 times higher catalytic activities than the commercially available Pt (ETEK) catalyst towards C-1 to C-3 alcohol oxidation reactions, respectively. The exceptional catalytic activity and stability of highly efficient monodisperse Pt nanoparticles towards agglomeration leaching and CO poisoning allow these particles to be recycled and reused in the catalysis of DMAB dehydrogenation and C-1 to C-3 alcohol oxidation. After fifth subsequent reaction and recovery cycles, the prepared nanocatalyst retained almost >80% activity towards the complete dehydrogenation of DMAB and C-1 to C-3 alcohol oxidation.

TI  - CdS-loaded flexible carbon nanofiber mats as a platform for solar hydrogen production
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Photocatalysis-based solar hydrogen (H-2) has garnered attention as a renewable energy carrier, yet the technology is still immature. For practical operation of photocatalytic H-2 production, we fabricated a novel heterojunction of CdS-loaded flexible carbon nanofiber (CNF) mats. CNF mats were prepared by electrospinning and carbonization. CdS nanoparticles were deposited in alcohol and water solutions by the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. The former solution was found to be more effective in uniformly dispersing CdS particles in the CNF mats. When pristine CNF mats were treated with acid (hereafter CdS/a-CNF), the degree of CdS particle distribution was further enhanced. Moreover, H-2 production was improved by a factor of 3 in an aqueous solution of Na2S (0.1 M) and Na2SO3 (0.1 M) under visible light (lambda > 420 nm). Heat-treatment of CdS/a-CNF mats at 400 degrees C dramatically increased H2 production by 3.6 times due to the improved crystallinity of the CdS particles. In this heterojunction, the CNF mats have three roles: They work as a multi-scalable support for CdS particles, enhance photogenerated charge transfers, and catalyze H-2 evolution.

TI  - Light-induced confined growth of amorphous Co doped MoSx nanodots on TiO2 nanoparticles for efficient and stable in situ photocatalytic H-2 evolution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Amorphous molybdenum sulfide (a-MoSx) prepared by in situ photoreduction method with an abundance of exposed active sites has been identified as an efficient cocatalyst for catalyzing photocatalytic H-2 evolution reaction (HER). However, the intrinsic activity of the a-MoSx cocatalyst toward HER is low due to the unfavorable electronic structures of the active sites. Herein, we report a facile light-induced method for the confined growth of transition metal (TM) doped MoSx (a-TM-MoSx) cocatalysts on TiO2 nanoparticles and their catalytic activity for in situ photocatalytic HER. It is found that doping Co into a-MoSx can greatly enhance the activity of resulted a-Co-MoSx cocatalyst for photocatalytic H-2 evolution over TiO2 among the transition metal dopants (Co, Ni, Fe, Cu, Zn) tested. The most efficient a-Co-MoSx cocatalyst (Co/Mo = 1/4 and 4 mol% loading) loaded TiO2 (TiO2/a-Co-MoSx) shows a H-2 evolution rate of 133.8 mu mol h(-1), which is 3.3 times higher than that of a-MoSx loaded TiO2 (TiO2/a-MoSx). Moreover, the TiO2/a-Co-MoSx photocatalyst shows excellent recycling H-2 evolution stability. The characterization results reveal that a-Co-MoSx cocatalyst can not only effectively capture the photogenerated electrons of TiO2 to greatly enhance the separation efficiency of photogenerated charges but also significantly reduce the overpotential of HER due to the formation of highly active "CoMoS" sites, thus synergistically enhancing the catalytic activity of TiO2/a-Co-MoSx. Moreover, the light-induced growth of a-Co-MoSx on TiO2 is found to readily couple with the in situ photocatalytic HER. Therefore, this work provides a simple and efficient strategy for designing high-performance a-MoSx-based cocatalysts for stable in situ photocatalytic H-2 evolution.

TI  - Electrocatalysis of oxygen reduction when varying the mass ratio of metal nanoparticles to carbon support for catalysts with a 10 to 10 to 80 mol% of Pt and Pd on Ag
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The reduction of total Pt-loading in a cathode catalyst without sacrificing performance is one of the key objectives for the large-scale commercialization of proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) technology. A core-shell type nanostructured catalyst with a Pt-loading 20 times lower than a commercial catalyst is demonstrated herein to be more active for the electrocatalysis of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acid electrolyte. The weight ratio of metal nanoparticles on carbon support is the key to achieving the highest ORR activity in a series of silver-based catalysts, all with 10 mol percent of Pt and 10 mol percent of Pd over 80 mol percent of silver (Ag) and supported on untreated Vulcan carbon to form an electrocatalyst (Ag@Pt10Pd10/C) with either 5, 10, 20 or 30 wt% of total metals on carbon; which correspond to a Pt concentration around 1, 2, 3 and 5 wt%, respectively. All metal nanostructures on carbon show a similar morphology, size and structure. Thin films of these four Ag@Pt10Pd10/C catalysts on rotating disk electrodes (TF-RDEs) all shown a 4-electrons pathway for the ORR and give higher exchange current densities (j(o) > 3.8 mA/cm(2)) than a commercial Etek Pt-20/C catalyst (j(o) = 2.4 mA/cm(2)). The Ag@Pt10Pd10/C catalyst with 5 wt% of total metals (1 wt% of Pt) on carbon gives the best electrocatalysis; reducing molecular oxygen to water two times faster and generating 25% higher current per milligram of platinum (mass activity) than the commercial catalyst (Pt-20/C). Therefore, the Ag@Pt10Pd10/C catalyst with 5 wt% of total metals is a new catalyst for ORR for a PEMFC with a lower Pt loading and cost. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Application of intensive hydrodynamic cavitation in liquids for synthesis of hydrogen and nanoparticles
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the results of experimental studies of hydrogen and nanoparticles production using intensive hydrodynamic cavitation in liquids are presented. Physicochemical processes occurring in a cavitation bubble at the last stage of its compression are very similar to processes occurring in the explosion chamber. The values of pressure and temperature achieved in this case ensure the thermodynamic stability of the reaction products and the production of a gaseous hydrogen and nanoclusters as a result of decomposition of molecules of liquid, which is confirmed by theoretical calculations. The controlled addition of hydrogen-containing liquids and the change in the compression conditions of cavitation bubbles make it possible to control the process of hydrogen synthesis, which is an important step in the development of modern high-tech alternative energy methods. The pulsation of a spherical cavity is described by the Kirkwood Bethe equations, which are one of the most accurate mathematical models of pulsation processes at an arbitrary velocity of the cavity boundary. The model allows to describe the process of pulsations of cavitation cavities, conduct comprehensive parametric studies and evaluate the effect of various process parameters on the collapse of cavities. This work continues with the experiments on cavitation synthesis of carbon nano structures. With the rapid movement of chemically pure hydrocarbons along the profiled channel in the form of a Venturi nozzle, cavitation bubbles form in the liquid, which are then compressed in the working chamber, in which a sharp pressure surge is created. The pressure in the shock wave, which reaches 80-90 MPa, ensures the collapse of cavitation bubbles close to adiabatic compression. As a result of the number of rapidly occurring physicochemical processes of evaporation, heating, and thermal dissociation of hydrocarbon vapors, a solid carbon phase including graphene oxide nanoparticles and a gaseous hydrogen-containing phase are synthesized in the cavitation, which is then subjected to separation. Synthesized graphene oxide nanoparticles possess activated surface due to the cavitation action and can be subsequently used as substrates for modification with functional nanoparticles, e.g. silver nano particles with antibacterial properties. The article is of great help to scientists and design engineers who are engaged in the development of promising hydrogen generating facilities and hydrogen complexes.

TI  - Architecture of porous CoS1.097-C composite nanowire for efficient oxygen reduction reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Design and preparation of efficient and low cost electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is vitally important for the commercialization of alkaline direct methanol fuel cell (ADMFC). Herein, porous CoS1.097-C composite nanowire is prepared by one-step in-situ pyrolyzing Co-nitrilotriacetic acid (Co-NTA) precursor in Ar atmosphere with adding S powder. The obtained CoS1.097-C composite nanowire gathered by carbon encapsulated CoS1.097 nanoparticles are further analyzed by FT-IR, XRD, SEM, TEM, Raman, BET and XPS. The optimized CoS1.097-C composite nanowire catalyst shows the onset potential of 0.90 V and half-wave potential of 0.79 V with the acquired tafel slope of 57.7 dec(-1) for ORR in 0.1 M KOH. Further studies indicate that the effective four-electron pathway contributes to excellent ORR activity. Moreover, the CoS1.097-C composite nanowire catalyst exhibits good durability and methanol tolerance over the commercial Pt/C. This work provides a general strategy for developing carbon-based transition metal sulfide nanocomposite as cathode in ADMFC. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Enhanced photocatalytic activity of all-solid-state g-C3N4/Au/P25 Z-scheme system for visible-light-driven H-2 evolution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We constructed an all-solid-state g-C3N4/Au/P25 Z-scheme system combining graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and P25 with Au nanoparticles, as an electron mediator, for hydrogen production under visible-light irradiation (lambda > 400 nm). The g-C3N4/Au/P25 system was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electronic microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-Vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (UV -Vis DRS), photoluminescence (PL), time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL), and electrochemical measurements. TEM and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) clearly reveal the morphology and structure of g-C3N4/Au/P25, implying the existence of the all-solid-state Z-scheme system. The results of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and TRPL indicate that the Z-scheme system can effectively promote the electron transfer rate and the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs for the vectorial electron transfer of P25 -> 4Au -> g-C3N4. The Z-scheme system can also extend the visible light absorption wavelength from 460 to 700 nm due to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of Au nanoparticles, which is confirmed by UV-Vis DRS and incident photo-to-current efficiency (IPCE) measurements. The synergistic effect of the all-solid-state g-C3N4/Au/P25 Z-scheme system and the Au-induced SPR results in a highly efficient photocatalytic performance with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 259 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), which is 30 times higher than that of pristine g-C3N4.

TI  - Optimizations of rGO supported CdS photo-electrocatalyst for dissociation of water
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper reports fabrication of electrode containing rGO supported CdS catalyst for photoelectrochemical reduction of water to hydrogen. The reduction of GO to r GO was carried out electrochemically in situ. The catalyst which contained 10 wt GO with CdS showed the best activity. Catalysts were characterized by XRD, FTIR, DRS, SEM, TEM, SED, XPS, PL, EIS and Mott-Schottky analysis. It is reported that incorporation of r GO to CdS resulted into formation of heterojunction at the interface of CdS and rGO by a chemical interaction between the two. Consequently, a greater band bending, a higher charge carrier density, a low resistance for electronic mobility and low recombination rate result in. The high activity of the catalyst is due to the above mention attributes. These effects become prominent with the increase in the loading of GO, however, any loading in excess of 10 wt % resulted into its shielding of CdS which adversely affected the activity.

TI  - Effect of LDH composition on the catalytic activity of Ru/LDH for the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane (NH3-BH3, AB for short) in the presence of catalysts has been identified to be a safe and efficient way for hydrogen release. Understanding the dehydrogenation mechanism of AB is helpful and important to design efficient catalysts. So far, although the effects of various factors on dehydrogenation of AB have been studied, such as the noble metal particle size effect, crystal-phase effect and the support crystal plane effect, the effect of support composition on dehydrogenation of AB has rarely been reported yet. In this study, we choose composition-adjustable layered double hydroxide (MgAl-LDHs) as support for Ru nanoparticles, and use the as-prepared catalysts for comparing their catalytic activity towards the dehydrogenation of AB. The catalytic results demonstrate the catalytic activity of Ru/MgAl-LDHs is related to MgAl-LDHs composition, exhibiting a support-composition effect in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of AB. Combining various characterizations, the different composition of MgAl-LDHs has an effect on the interaction between Ru nanoparticles and MgAl-LDHs, which directly affects the catalytic activity for the hydrolysis of AB. This study provides new important fundamental knowledge on the mechanism of AB hydrolysis over practical supported metal catalysts which can be used for a better catalyst design.

TI  - Electrosynthesis of dendritic palladium supported on Ti/TiO2NTs/Ni/CeO2 as high-performing and stable anode electrocatalyst for methanol electrooxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Liquid-fueled direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) is highly promising for low-carbon transportation, but is hindered by high cost and short lifespan of conventional Pt-based electrocatalysts. Herein, we propose a new Pt-free catalyst strategy to exploit high-performing and stable electrocatalyst of DMFC, achieving enhanced electrocatalytic activity and high stability for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in alkaline media. A new Pt-free anode catalysts consisting of titanium/reduced-titanium dioxide nanotubes/nickel/cerium diox-ide (Ti/r-TiO2NTs/Ni/CeO2) nanosupport and uniformly-dispersed Pd dendrites is suc-cessfully prepared by a facile three-step electrodeposition route without applying any template or surfactant. Noticeably, the as-prepared Ti/r-TiO2NTs/Ni/CeO2-Pd as an anode electrode exhibits superior activity than commercial Pd/C and other electrodes. The ob-tained large mass activity for Ti/r-TiO2NTs/Ni/CeO2-Pd electrode is 1752 mA mgPd?1 for MOR. After successive CV tests of 1000 cycles, Ti/r-TiO2NTs/Ni/CeO2-Pd electrode still retained 88.9% of its initial current. The superior performance of Ti/r-TiO2NTs/Ni/CeO2-Pd attri-butes to the large surface area and excellent conductivity, as well as the synergistic effects among nanosupport and Pd dendrites. Therefore, this study will open a new door for high-performance fuel cell applications. (C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - PtCo/N-doped carbon sheets derived from a simple pyrolysis of graphene oxide/ZIF-67/H2PtCl6 composites as an efficient catalyst for methanol electro-oxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Many alloy catalysts have been developed for methanol electro-oxidation, but most synthetic methods are complicated. Herein, PtCo alloy catalysts supported on N-doped carbon sheets (PtCo/NCS) are successfully prepared by a simple pyrolysis of graphene oxide/ZIF-67/H2PtCl6 composites at different temperatures (700, 800, 900 degrees C) under a gas flow of H-2/Ar, in which ZIF-67 is served as Co and N sources. SEM, TEM, XRD, XPS and electrochemical characterization are employed to study as-prepared catalysts. In acidic methanol solution, the area-specific activity (1.25 mA cm(-2) Pt) of PtCo alloy catalyst obtained at 800 degrees C (PtCo/ NCS-800) is 2.6 times of commercial Pt/C (0.48 mA cm(-2) Pt), and the area-specific activity of PtCo/NCS-800 is 3.5 times of Pt/C after 1000 cycles. Furthermore, an improved CO-tolerance of Pt is confirmed. The electronic effect and synergistic effect of metallic elements are responsible for outstanding performance of as-prepared catalysts. This work provides a simple approach to obtain high performance alloy catalysts. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The as-prepared NG-ZnS-modified ITO electrode displayed excellent photocatalytic activity, rapid transient photocurrent response, superior stability and high recyclability compared to the pure ZnS and G-ZnS-modified ITO electrode due to the synergy between the photocatalytic activity of ZnS nanorods and the large surface area and high conductivity of N-graphene.

TI  - Surfactant assisted synthesis of Pt-Pd/MWCNT and evaluation as cathode catalyst for proton exchange membrane fuel cell
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the role of two types of surfactants, the anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and cationic cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) on the synthesis and properties of multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) supported bi-metallic Pt-Pd (atomic ratio 1:1) nanoparticles (NPs) and assess their performance as cathode catalyst in proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). Pt-Pd/CNT catalysts are prepared through microwave assisted, polyol route in presence of SDS (Pt-Pd/CNT-S) or CTAB (Pt-Pd/CNT-C) and their performance is compared with Pt-Pd/CNT prepared in an identical way without any surfactant. The study shows the prominent influence of the type of surfactant in disaggregation of MWCNT bundles and the dispersion of Pt-Pd NPs on MWCNT support, which in turn controls their catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction. In-situ electrochemical characterization studies show improvement in the catalytic activity of Pt-Pd/CNT-S compared to Pt-Pd/CNT-C and Pt-Pd/CNT, demonstrating SDS as an efficient disperser for MWCNT. High fuel cell performance achieved with Pt-Pd/CNT-S having less Pt content (similar to 12 wt %) than the commonly employed pure Pt or Pt/C (20 wt %) catalysts demonstrates that it is a potential cathode catalyst for PEMFC that can help its wider commercialization.

TI  - Defective-MoS2/rGO heterostructures with conductive 1T phase MoS2 for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As a two-dimensional material, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) exhibits great potential to replace metal platinum-based catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, poor electrical conductivity and low intrinsic activity of MoS2 limit its application in electrocatalysis. Herein, we prepare a defective-MoS2/rGO heterostructures material containing 1T phase MoS2 and evaluate its HER performance. The experimental results shown that defective-MoS2/rGO heterostructures exhibits outstanding HER performance with a low overpotential at 154.77 mV affording the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and small Tafel slope of 56.17 mV dec(-1). The unique HER performance of as-prepared catalyst can be attributed to the presence of 1T phase MoS2, which has more active sites and higher intrinsic conductivity. While the defects of as-prepared catalyst fully expose the active sites and further improve catalytic activity. Furthermore, the interaction between MoS2 and rGO heterostructures can accelerate electron transfer kinetics, and effectively ensure that the obtained catalyst displays excellent conductivity and structural stability, so the as prepared catalyst also exhibits outstanding electrochemical cycling stability. This work provides a feasible and effective method for preparation of defective-MoS2/rGO heterostructures, which also supplies a new strategy for designing of highly active and conductive catalysts for HER.

TI  - Electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Review
AB  - In addition to the historical importance of water electrolysis, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is the heart of various energy storage and conversation systems in the future of renewable energy. The HER electrocatalysis can be well conducted by Pt with a low over potential close to zero and a Tafel slope around 30 mV dec(-1); however, the practical developments to satisfy the growing demands require cheaper electrocatalysts. Noble metals are still the promising candidates, though further improvement is needed to enhance the HER efficiency in performance. Three categories of non-noble metal electrocatalysts are under heavy investigations: (i) alloys, (ii) transition metal compounds, and (iii) carbonaceous nanomaterials. The most practical option, based on the electrocatalytic activity and electrochemical stability, seems to be the transition metal compounds MX (where M is Mo, W, Ni, Co, etc. and Xis S, Se, P, C, N, etc.). Among these compounds, some like MoS2 and WC can display metallic properties and a Pt-like electrocatalytic activity, but they still need serious modifications for the practical performance. In general, similar strategies have been employed to improve the HER performance of all of these materials such as doping (both cation and anion), controlling the crystallinity and amorphism, and increasing the active sites by changing the morphology. Another important issue is the chemical and physical structure of the carbon-based catalyst support, as carbon is normally a vital component even for the Pt electrocatalysts.

The highest H-2 production (3.44 mmol g(-1) h(-1)) was obtained for ZnO-20 wt% ZnBi2O4 sample, which is around 12.7 times higher than pure ZnO. According to the HRTEM result, the intimate interfacial connections are formed between ZnO and ZnBi2O4 which could act as trapping centers for charge carriers and results in the boosted photocatalytic activity. Further, a high aspect ratio of 1D ZnO nanorods and small size of 0D ZnBi2O4 nanoparticles (similar to 10 nm) increases the number of interfacial contacts and thus the charge carriers' recombination was suppressed more efficiently. Based on the trapping experiments, ESR and Mott-Schottky analysis, ZnBi2O4-ZnO hybrid photocatalyst followed the S-scheme charge transfer mechanism. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Adsorption of hydrogen atoms on graphene with TiO2 decoration
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Graphene-based nanocomposites are regarded as potential candidate for hydrogen storage. In this work, the energetics of the hydrogen adsorption on graphene with TiO2 decoration is systematically investigated based on first-principles total energy calculations. TiO2 cluster is chemisorbed on graphene via O-C bonds. The C atoms near TiO2 cluster act as the nucleation positions for the hydrogen atom adsorption, and the binding energy of hydrogen atoms on graphene is significantly enhanced due to the decoration of TiO2 clusters, which is larger than the binding energy of hydrogen atoms in hydrogen molecules. It can be deduced that the hydrogen storage capacity could reach 7.3 wt. %, provided that the content of TiO2 in graphene is 5 wt. %. The results give a comprehensive understanding on electrochemical hydrogen storage behavior of graphene-based nanocomposites. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC

TI  - Simultaneous removal of Cd(II) and phenol pollutions through magnetic graphene oxide nanocomposites coated polyaniline using low temperature plasma technique
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Herein, polyaniline functionalized magnetic graphene oxide composites (PANI-g-MGOs) are successfully prepared through adopting low temperature plasma induced technique. The synthesized PANI-g-MGOs composites having excellent saturation magnetization and physicochemical stabilization can be separated using external magnet and removed simultaneously cadmium ion and phenol contaminants. The underlying interaction mechanisms of PANI-g-MGOs towards cadmium ion and phenol are conducted under coexistence experimental conditions. The adsorption kinetics processes and isotherms performances of cadmium ion and phenol onto PANI-g-MGOs composites can be remarkably imitated with pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir model, respectively. The adsorption performance of Cd(II) ion onto PANI-g-MGOs composites is remarkably increased by coexistent phenol, whereas the adsorption of phenol onto PANI-g-MGOs composites is not influenced with Cd(II) ion coexisting in binary solutions systems. The outer-sphere surface complexation or ion exchange is dominantly assigned to Cd(II) ion adsorption onto PANI-g-MGOs composites at low pH values, and then inner-sphere surface complexation is primary adsorption mechanism at high pH values. The adsorption performance of phenol onto PANI-g-MGOs is contributed to tc-rc conjugate interaction between aromatic ring of phenol and special structures of PANI-g-MGOs. The experimental results illustrate that PANI-g-MGOs composites can be utilized as latent adsorbents for efficient remove of cadmium ion and phenol from wastewater in environmental remediation.

TI  - Peony petal-like 3D graphene-nickel oxide nanocomposite decorated nickel foam as high-performance electrocatalyst for direct glucose alkaline fuel cell
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nickel foam modified by various electron mediators is an ideal non-noble metal anode for direct glucose alkaline fuel cell. However, high cost, low stability, and toxicity of electron mediators largely hamper their practical application. Herein, we demonstrated a one-step electrodeposition method to produce high-performance nickel foam electrode decorated with reduced graphene oxides and nickel oxides. The structure and morphology of the resulting 3D graphene-nickel oxide nanocomposites were characterized by UV-Vis, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. Furthermore, a composite anode was prepared by rolling an activated carbon layer on the fabricated nickel foam electrode. At ambient temperature, the fuel cell equipped with the composite anode exhibited excellent performance with a high peak power density of 13.48 W m(-2) under the condition of 1 M glucose, 3 M KOH, which was 39.30% higher than that of the bare activated carbon anode cell. In particular, electrochemical measurements demonstrated the high performance of the nanocomposite modified activated carbon anode was likely attributed to the synergistic effect of high conductivity of graphene and the catalytic activity of trivalent nickel towards glucose oxidation.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Pristine graphene oxide (GO) sheets were pretreated with polyethyleneimine (PEI) to prepare PEI-modified GO (PEI-GO), which was further inserted with ZIF-8 crystals to form a novel PEI-GO@ZIF-8 nanocomposite for CO2 capture. The good dispersion of PEI and interlayer growth of ZIF-8 within the GO sheets is helpful for high CO2 adsorption. Therefore, the PEI-GO@ZIF-8 nanocomposite show high surface area and enhanced CO2 adsorption capacity. The adsorption capacity of the PEI-GO@ZIF-8 nanocomposite was six times higher than that of the pristine GO and ZIF-8. The CO2/N-2 adsorption selectivity was significantly improved due to amine groups loading which provide more sites for CO2 adsorption. The preferential adsorption of CO2 over N-2 makes PEI-GO@ZIF-8 nano composite be a promising candidate in the field of CO2 capture. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The 1-6 H-2 molecule adsorption energy and electronic properties of sandwich graphene-Pd(T)-Graphene (G-Pd(T)-G) structure were studied by the first-principle analysis. The binding energies, adsorption energies, and adsorption distances of Pd atoms-modified single-layer graphene and bilayer graphene with H-2 molecules at B, H, T adsorption sites were calculated. In bilayer graphene, the adsorption properties at T sites were found to be more stable than those at B and H sites. The binding energy of Pd atoms (4.16 eV) on bilayer graphene was higher than the experimental cohesion energy of Pd atoms (3.89 eV), and this phenomenon eliminated the impact of metal clusters on adsorption properties. It was found that three H-2 molecules were stably adsorbed on the G-Pd(T)-G structure with an average adsorption energy of 0.22 eV. Therefore, it can be speculated that G-Pd(T)-G is an excellent hydrogen storage material. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Electrosynthesis of hierarchical Cu2O-Cu(OH)(2) nanodendrites supported on carbon nanofibers/poly(para-phenylenediamine) nanocomposite as high-efficiency catalysts for methanol electrooxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of highly efficient catalysts using inexpensive and earth-abundant metals is a crucial factor in a large-scale commercialization of direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). In this study, we explored a new catalyst based on copper nanodendrites (CuNDs) supported on carbon nanofibers/poly (para-phenylenediamine) (CNF/PpPD) nanocomposite for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). The catalyst support was prepared on a carbon paste electrode by electropolymerization of para-phenylenediamine monomer on a drop cast carbon nanofibers network. Afterwards, CuNDs were electrodeposited on the nano composite through a potentiostatic method. The morphology and the structure of the prepared nanomaterials were characterized by transmission electron microscope, scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive X-ray, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscope. The results suggested that a three-dimensional nanodendritic structure consisting of Cu2O and Cu(OH)(2) formed on the hybrid CNF/PpPD nanocomposite. The catalytic performance of CuNDs supported on CNF, PpPD and CNF/PpPD was evaluated for MOR under alkaline conditions. The CNF/PpPD/CuNDs exhibits a highest activity (50 mA cm(-2)) and stability toward MOR over 6 h, with respect to CNF/CuNDs (40 mA cm(-2)) and PpPD/CuNDs (36 mA cm(-2)). This inexpensive catalyst with high catalytic activity and stability is a promising anode catalyst for alkaline DMFC applications. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - The effect of silver nanoparticles/graphene-coupled TiO2 beads photocatalyst on the photoconversion efficiency of photoelectrochemical hydrogen production
T2  - NANOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, a novel configuration of the photoelectrochemical hydrogen production device is demonstrated. It is based on TiO2 beads as the primary photoanode material with the addition of a heterostructure of silver nanoparticles/graphene. The heterostructure not only caters to a great improvement in light harvesting efficiency (LHE) but also enhances the charge collection efficiency. For LHE, the optimized cell based on TiO2 beads/Ag/graphene shows a 47% gain as compared to the cell having a photoanode of commercial P25 TiO2 powders. For the charge collection efficiency, there is a pronounced improvement of an impressive value of 856%. The reason for the improvement in light absorption is attributed to either the light scattering of TiO2 beads or the surface plasmonic resonance on the Ag nanoparticles/graphene. The photoconversion efficiency (PCE) of the resulting cells is also presented and discussed. The PCE of the TiO2 beads/Ag/graphene cell is approximately 2.5 times than that of pure P25 cell.

TI  - Transition Metal Selenides for Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction
T2  - CHEMELECTROCHEM
M3  - Review
AB  - Electrolysis of water is regarded as an attractive and feasible way for producing hydrogen. So far, various non-noble metal nanomaterials have been reported as excellent electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction. Especially, due to the low cost, earth-abundance and tunable properties, transition metal selenides with different compositions, sizes and structures have been explored broadly as efficient catalysts with the relatively high activities, high stabilities and high efficiencies in full pH range of electrolyte for electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction. Thus, in this Minireview, after introducing several commonly used electrochemical terms about hydrogen evolution reaction, we mainly focus on various kinds of the transition metal selenides that have been documented as electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction. Particularly, the merits and demerits of transition metal selenides for hydrogen evolution reaction are systematically discussed. Moreover, we also analyze the encountered challenges and present an outlook for the rapid development of transition metal selenides. We hope this Minireview can bring some fundamental understanding for the readers interested in the transition metal selenides and hydrogen evolution reaction.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Adsorption isotherm suggested the formation of mesoporous structural design within a 3D self-assembled SA-GWO architecture electrode. Bi-functional (HER and OER) activity has been displayed by SA-GWO electrodes at the combined full potential of 1.9 V and attains the standard 10 mA/cm2 (1 M H2SO4, 28 degrees C). Remarkably, it exhibits OER activity in the acidic medium, which is so far very limited. The tafel slope and the exchange current density for the HER process are observed to be 117 mV/decade and 1.73 x 10-3 mA/cm2, respectively, at 28 degrees C. Importantly, the production rate of hydrogen is found to increase with increasing temperature. HER is highly dominated by the Volmer route. Gas liberated at the respective electrode has been tested via gas chromatography (GC) analysis. SA-GWO supports the faradaic efficiency of 73 and 52% for HER and OER, respectively. Tafel slope for OER appeared to be very high owing to its complex mechanistic pathway. Disintegra-tion of 3D monoclinic WO3 and the formation of 2D nanochannels like nanostructure have been distinctly observed in SEM micro images, when the electrode is subjected to cathodic HER reaction (-0.5 V, 1 M H2SO4). Most importantly, the WO3 polymorph typically responsible for the distinct mechanism of HER and OER action in 1 M H2SO4 has been identified and proven. Moreover, the 3D SA-GWO electrode as HER possesses great endurance and incomparable stability in acidic media.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - In situ grown nickel nanoparticles in a calixarene nanoreactor on a graphene-MoS2 support for efficient water electrolysis
T2  - SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS
M3  - Article
AB  - Electrochemical production of hydrogen, facilitated in electrolysers, holds great promise for energy storage and solar fuel production. Catalysis of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a bottleneck of this process. However, the sluggish OER kinetics and the utilization of precious metal catalysts are key obstacles in the broad deployment of this energy technology. We report the preparation and use of an inexpensive GrMoS(2)SC(8)Ni nanocomposite material as a highly effective OER catalyst in an alkaline electrolyte. Experimental investigations have shown that improvements can be realized in the catalytic performance of Ni metal if it is a component of the composite material. We propose an explanation for these enhancements based on a hydrogen acceptor concept. This concept comprises the stabilization of an *-OOH intermediate, which effectively lowers the potential needed for breaking bonds on the surface. Herein, an inexpensive immobilized SC8 layer was used as the nanoreactor to synthesize metallic Ni nanoparticles (NPs) through an in situ redox process. The process was applied to form immobilized NPs on flat and curved 2D surfaces. The outstanding OER performance of Ni NPs could be attributed to their large surface area, efficient mass and charge transport, and high structural stability arising from the unique SC8 cage structure, built on the GrMoS(2) substrate. The GrMoS(2)SC(8)Ni nanocomposite shows the highest activity, exhibiting a 214 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) (equivalent to 10% efficiency of solarto-fuel conversion) and a Tafel slope of 31 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH solution. It further demonstrates high stability as there is no apparent OER activity loss (based on a chronoamperometry test) or particle aggregation (based on SEM image observation) after a 10 h anodization test. The facile preparation method and high efficiency and durability enable this electrocatalyst to be a promising candidate for future large-scale applications in water splitting. Thus, this work opens a new avenue toward the development of highly efficient, inexpensive OER catalysts.

TI  - CoFe2O4 nanoparticles anchored on N/S co-doped mesoporous carbon spheres as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen catalytic reactions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The development of a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen catalytic reactions such as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is highly desirable owing to the sluggish kinetics that limit these reactions. In this study, CoFe2O4 nanoparticles anchored on nitrogen and sulfur co-doped mesoporous carbon spheres (CFO/NS-MCS) were prepared as nonprecious metal catalysts, using a facile pyrolysis and hydrothermal treatment process. The co-doping of N and S into the carbon spheres was achieved using thiourea, which played a key role in the bimetallic covalent coupling in the NS-MCS. The as-prepared CFO/NS-MCS exhibited a more promising ORR catalytic performance compared with that of commercial Pt/C, which was attributed to the presence of highly active sites. Remarkably, the CFO/NS-MCS catalysts also showed a high OER catalytic performance comparable with that of commercial RuO2/C in the aspects of onset potential and Tafel slope, and showed a better durability for oxygen catalytic reactions in an alkaline solution. The approach indicated in this research can be applied to develop high-performance electrocatalysts for practical implementation in energy storage and conversion devices.

AB  - Free-standing carbon nanotube films (CNTF) with entangled carbon nanotubes (CNT) were used as conductive supports for the preparation of CuS-ZnS/CNTF composite as immobilized photocatalysts for H-2 production. The surface morphology, crystalline property, surface chemistry, and optical properties of the CuS-ZnS/CNTF photocatalysts were investigated. The effects of forming CuS-ZnS heterojunction and conductive CNTF on the separation of photogenerated charges and photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of CuS-ZnS/CNTF photocatalysts were evaluated by the photocatalytic hydrogen production tests. Conductive CNT films can prevent the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. The deposition of CuS nanoparticles on the ZnS/CNTF leads to higher photocatalytic activity which can be attributed to the effective electron-hole separation. Introducing ZnS and CuS makes the photocatalyst surface more hydrophilic. The porous structure contributed to the effective contact between the sacrificing agents and the photocatalysts, leading to enhanced H-2 production activity.

Developing inexpensive electrocatalyst with low Pt loading and high platinum utilization efficiency is one of effective strategies to lower the cost of platinum-based electrocatalyst. In this paper, it was demonstrated that ultrafine and uniform distribution platinum nanoparticles could be synthesized on three-dimensional sulfur-doped graphene materials (Pt/3DSG) via covalent cross-linking between platinum and doped sulfur atoms. The high conductive 3DSG not only facilitates the electron transport but also serves as a template for depositing ultrafine and uniform platinum nanoparticles. The Pt/3DSG with low Pt loading (3.1 wt%) delivers extremely outstanding HER performance, which is superior to the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst. The turnover frequencies (TOFs) of Pt/3DSG can reach 1.12 s(-1), which is larger than that of 20% Pt/C (0.71 s(-1)). Furthermore, the stability is also superior than that of Pt/C. This work provides a rational design strategy for highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts with low loading and high utilization of precious metal. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A facile and rapid sonochemical method has been developed for the synthesis of Co2SnO4 nanostructures in presence of glucose as a green capping agent, for the first time. The effect of different parameters such as ultrasonic irradiation, time irradiation, basic agent and solvent were studied to reach optimum size and morphology conditions. The optimized Co2SnO4 nanostructures anchored onto graphene sheets and Co2SnO4/Graphene nanocomposite synthesized through pre-graphenization, successfully. In this paper, hydrogen storage capacity of optimized Co2SnO4 nanostructures and Co2SnO4/Graphene nanocomposite compared for the first time. Co2SnO4/Graphene nanocomposite show more excellent electrochemical performance than pure Co2SnO4 nanoparticles. It was found that the synergistic effect between Co2SnO4 nanoparticles and graphene sheets can improve the electrochemical performance of this hybrid composites electrode. After 25 cycles, the discharging capacities of the Co2SnO4 nanostructure and Co2SnO4/Graphene nano composite electrode reach 1190 and 2700 mAh/g, respectively.

TI  - An improved preparation of graphene supported ultrafine ruthenium (0) NPs: Very active and durable catalysts for H-2 generation from methanolysis of ammonia borane
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - An improved route was developed to prepare graphene supported ultrafine Ru nanoparticles (NPs) by two steps in this work. Exfoliated graphene oxide suspensions were firstly prepared by the intercalated reaction of tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH) with graphite oxide (GO), followed by the deposition of Ru NPs to obtain Ru/graphene. The as-prepared Ru/graphene was characterized by many techniques, including TEM, SEM, EDX, UV Vis, Raman spectra, and XPS. It was found that remarkably uniform and dispersed Ru NPs with sizes of about 1.57 nm that possessed high crystallinity were supported on the surface of exfoliated graphene sheet. The catalytic activity and reusability of Ru/graphene were evaluated by the methanolysis of ammonia borane (H3NBH3, AB) at ambient temperature. Results showed that Ru/graphene was a very active and stable catalyst as it provided 35,600 total turnovers over a period of 300 h before deactivation in the methanolysis of AB at 20 degrees C. The first-order reaction kinetic modes of both catalyst amount and AB concentration were constructed for the AB methanolysis reaction catalyzed by Ru/graphene, and the apparent activation energy (Ea) for the methanolysis dehydrogenation of AB was 54.1 +/- 2 kJ/mol. Additionally, the Ru/graphene catalyst also demonstrated satisfactory durable stability for H-2 generation from the methanolysis dehydrogenation of AB. In principle, the unique strategy could be also applied to, but not limited to other metal or alloy NPs in fabrication of highly active graphene-based nanocatalysts.

TI  - The fabrication of silane modified graphene oxide supported Ni-Co bimetallic electrocatalysts: A catalytic system for superior oxygen reduction in microbial fuel cells
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) exploit the ability of microorganisms to generate clean energy from organic pollutants in wastewater. However, the poor cathode performance and the use of the expensive rare metal platinum as a catalyst limit their application and scalability. In this study, we have synthesised a Ni-Co/GO nanocomposite and applied it as a potential cathode catalyst to single-chamber MFCs. To improve the performance of a Ni -Co-based hybrid nanocomposite, the support of graphene oxide (GO) is covalently modified with gamma-amino propyl tri-ethoxy silane (APTES) through a silane modification reaction. The physical and chemical properties of the synthesised materials are characterised with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) techniques. A microscopic study has shown that metal nanoparticles are distributed uniformly on the MGO matrix. The electrocatalytic activity of the synthesised hybrid nanocatalysts is analysed for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). A cyclic voltammetry experiment has shown that the Ni-Co/MGO catalyst exhibits a higher reduction peak current value and a higher positive onset potential than the Ni-Co/GO catalyst and Pt/C catalyst, indicating an enhanced ORR activity of the Ni-Co/MGO catalyst. Ni-Co/MGO also exhibits the highest initial current of 0.116 mA in the chronoamperometry test, which decreases to 0.049 mA after 16000 s. The electrochemical results demonstrate that the synthesised Ni-Co/MGO catalyst has a higher electrocatalytic activity and higher stability than the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst. More importantly, a MFC with Ni-Co/MGO as a cathode catalyst shows the maximum power density of 1003.18 mWm(-2), which is much higher than in the case of the Ni-Co/GO catalyst (889.6 mWm(-2)) and approximately 2.1 times higher than that of the state-of-the-art Pt/C (483.48 mWm(-2)). Consequently, the Ni-Co/MGO nanocomposite also shows the highest open circuit voltage of 0.857 V among the other studied catalysts. Moreover, the Ni-Co/MGO catalyst has a lower biofouling level than a commercial 10 wt% Pt/C catalyst, which shows that the synthesised cathode catalyst is superior in terms of stability, overall performance and usage. These results suggest that the newly developed Ni -Co/MGO catalyst can be applied as a potential substitute for the Pt/C cathode catalyst for the practical application of MFCs.

TI  - Nafion degradation mechanisms in proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) system: A review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Nafion is one of the polymer materials used as polymer electrode membrane (PEM) for fuel cells. However, the electrochemical reaction and water management processes that occur at the catalyst layer affect the performance and degradation of the membrane in the fuel cell resulting in various degradation mechanisms. Understanding the degradation mechanisms of the Nafion membrane in operation, the anhydrous and electrochemical conditions in the fuel cell is highly a necessity as outlined in this review. This review further recommends that further improvement in the Nafion membrane can be made by fabrication and coating the Nafion membrane with materials that can withstand the electrochemical environment in the fuel cell.

TI  - Electrodeposited laser-nanostructured electrodes for increased hydrogen production
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present work, a novel approach has been employed to effectively enlarge the elec-trocatalytic area of the electrodes in an alkaline electrolysis setup. This approach consists of a two-step electrode fabrication process: In the first step, ultrashort laser pulses have been used to nanostructure the electrode surface. In the second step, electrodeposition of nickel particles was performed in a modified Watt's bath. The resulting electrodes have been found to exhibit a significantly increased hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. Compared to the laser-nanostructured electrode (LN) and an untreated (i.e., flat) electrode, the electrodeposited-laser-nanostructured (ELN) electrode provides (i) enhanced electro-chemical values (ii) a significant increase of double-layer capacitance (C-DL) (values up to 1945 mF cm(-2)) compared to that of an LN electrode (288 mF cm(-2)) (iii) higher J(peaks) at CVs sweeps and (iv) lower Tafel slopes (-121 mV dec(-1) compared to-157 mv dec(-1)). The ELN electrode provides an overpotential value of vertical bar eta vertical bar(100) = 264 mV, which shows a noteworthy 34% decrease compared to a flat Ni electrode and a 15% decrease to an (LN) electrode. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the electrodeposition of nickel on the LN nickel electrodes results in a dendrite-like morphology of the surface. Thus, the enhancement of the HER has been attributed to the dendrite-like geometry and the concomitant enlargement of the electrocatalytic area of the electrode, which presents an electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) = 97 cm(-2) compared to 2.8 cm(-2) of the flat electrode. The electrodes have also been tested in actual hydrogen production condition, and it was found that the ELN electrode produces 4.5 times more hydrogen gas than a flat Ni electrode and 20% more hydrogen gas than an LN electrode (i.e. without the extra nickel electrodeposition).

TI  - Double quantum dots decorated 3D graphene flowers for highly efficient photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen production
T2  - APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Photoelectrocatalysis (PEC) has been demonstrated as a promising technique for hydrogen production. However, the high over-potential and high recombination rate of photo-induced electron-hole pairs lead to poor hydrogen production efficiency. In order to overcome these problems, TiO2 and Au dual quantum dots (QDs) on three-dimensional graphene flowers (Au@ TiO2@ 3DGFs) was synthesized by an electro-deposition strategy. The combination of Au and TiO2 modulates the band gap of TiO2, shifts the absorption to visible lights and improves the utilization efficiency of solar light. Simultaneously, the size-quantization TiO2 on 3DGFs not only achieves a larger specific surface area over conventional nanomaterials, but also promotes the separation of the photo-induced electron-hole pairs. Besides, the 3DGFs as a scaffold for QDs can provide more active sites and stable structure. Thus, the newly-developed Au@ TiO2@ 3DGFs composite exhibited an impressive PEC activity and excellent durability. Under-240 mV potential (vs. RHE), the photoelectric current density involved visible light illumination (100 mW cm(-2)) reached 90 mA cm(-2), which was about 3.6 times of the natural current density (without light, only 25 mA cm(-2)). It worth noting that the photoelectric current density did not degrade and even increased to 95 mA cm(-2) over 90 h irradiation, indicating an amazing chemical stability. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Development and characterization of rGO supported CdS-MoS2 photoelectrochemical catalyst for splitting water by visible light
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Development of a mixed phase MoS2 (1T/2H)-CdS supported on rGO photo-electrochemical catalyst for hydrogen production by splitting of water using visible light, has been reported. This catalyst showed a better efficiency compared to catalysts where either MoS2 was incorporated with CdS or MoS2 alone was supported on rGO. All the catalysts were photoactive under negative biasing. A detailed characterization of catalysts was performed using FTIR, XRD, DRS, HRSEM, HRTEM, SAED, XPS, and EIS etc. Higher activity of MoS2-CdS-rGO correlated with the formation of a mixed phase of MoS2, as well as a heterojunction at the interfaces of MoS2-CdS-rGO. Formation of the heterojunction and the presence of mixed phases of MoS2 have resulted into a better charge separation, a higher charge density and low resistance for charge transfer. These factors have attributed a higher efficiency of the catalyst. The probable mechanism of charge transfer is also discussed. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Preparation of NiO nanofibers by electrospinning and their application for electro-catalytic oxidation of ethylene glycol
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, nickel oxide nanofibers (NiO-NFs) are produced by electrospinning method and calcination in air for 5 h. The thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are used for characterization of the NiO-NFs. The FE-SEM images of the precursor indicate that a large quantity of nanofibers with diameters ranging from 100 to 150 nm with tens of micrometers in length can be acquired. Also, the results show that rough NiO-NFs having large specific surface area are composed of the small nanoparticles. After calcination, the nanofibers are composed of cubic structure. The EIS study shows that the value of charge-transfer resistance of the NiO-NFs modified carbon paste electrode (NiO-NFs/CPE) is much smaller than that CPE, indicating a faster electron-transfer process. The NiO-NFs are used as potential catalysts for electro-catalytic oxidation of ethylene glycol (EG) in 0.2 M NaOH solution. The results demonstrate that the NiO-NFs/CPE reveals good electro-catalytic activity towards EG oxidation, showing a suitable stability and robustness. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Synergistic catalytic activity of palladiume-silver alloy nanoparticle for anodic oxidation of ethanol in alkali
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Palladium and palladium-silver alloy nano catalysts were synthesized from aqueous precursor at room temperature via a single vessel chemical reduction and co-reduction methods in absence of capping agent. XPS analysis confirms the presence of Pd and Ag in the catalyst matrix. Microscopic analyses reveal spherical morphology of the catalyst in the nanoscale dimension. The electro-analytical investigation of the catalyst loaded on carbon electrode shows that the Pd4Ag nano alloy catalyst demonstrates marked improvement in electro-catalytic efficiency among all prepared catalysts for ethanol oxidation in alkali. The Pd4Ag/C catalyst shows the mass normalized peak current density of 522 mA mg(-1) Pd in cyclic voltammetric (CV) study, which is 1.97 times greater than that of similarly synthesized Pd/C (264.2 mA mg(-1)Pd) catalyst. Chronoamperometric and impedance analyses further establish the superiority of Pd4Ag/C catalyst. To discover the plausible mechanism, the CV study is typically extended to the intermediates like sodium acetate which reveals that though Pd is better for catalytic oxidation of intermediate than the best catalyst but the optimal OH- adsorption on the surface of the metal, favours catalytic oxidation of ethanol more on Pd4Ag catalyst. The mechanistic path of the reaction is anticipated by evaluating the ex-situ FTIR and chromatographic studies which explain the promotion of the formation of carboxylate in comparison to carbonate by Ag.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing a highly desirable multicomponent photocatalytic system for environmental remediation and water splitting is needed for current societal development. A visible active B-rGO/ZnFe2O4 photocatalyst was synthesized through the hydrothermal process, further magnify its electronic properties, the binary hybrid is modified with polypyrrole. The designed ternary hybrid utilizes the combining benefits of photo-sensitizer and interfacial charge transfer mechanism that ultimately boost its photocatalytic efficiency. The estab-lishment of interfacial p-n heterojunction via band-bending mechanism between B-rGO (BG) nanosheets and ZnFe2O4 (ZnF) nanoparticles was validated from photo-density in the opposite direction and upturned V-shaped Mott-Schottky plots. It was observed that 2BG/ ZnF@20PPY exhibits the best activity i.e., 100% reduction of 50 ppm Cr (VI) in 45 min and H2-production of 598 mmolh-1. Effective charge separation in 2BG/ZnF@20PPY is well sup -ported by PL, TRPL, EIS, transient-photocurrent, and donor density calculations. The strong contact among the constituents in 2BG/ZnF@20PPY is well-correlated with XPS and Raman characterization. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the present study, MWCNT-N,S-rGO supported CdS was synthesized at a higher temperature by the gas-solid reaction. Photoactivity was measured and compared with N, SrGO supported CdS. Incorporation of MWCNT prevents the restacking of the graphene layer and provides the high surface area for the dispersion of CdS which result in increasing the photoactivity of catalyst. It also increases the electrical conductivity which reduces the charge transfer resistance. Catalysts were characterized by FTIR, XRD, XPS, Raman spectroscopy, BET surface area analyzer, TEM, HRTEM, UV-Vis spectroscopy, PL spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Mott. Schottky analysis. The characterization results confirmed that incorporating MWCNT in N,S-rGO resulted in a higher rate of electron generation and also a higher rate of transfer of electrons to the solid-liquid interface and hence a higher activity.

TI  - Polyoxomolybdate anchored graphite oxide: Noble metal-free electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the synthesis of a noble metal-free electrocatalyst, polyoxomolybdate/reduced graphite oxide (PMA/rGO) composite, which showed enhancement in the kinetics for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The composite material was prepared by simple and cost effective method. Mere heating of the precursors at low temperature (200 degrees C) resulted in molecular assembly of PMA on GO in the form of clusters which behaved as active centers for efficient ORR. The electrochemical study of PMA/rGO-2 (PMA to GO weight ratio of 1:2) catalyst carried out by rotating disk electrode (RDE) method, showed considerable electrocatalytic activity with E-onset of 1.0 V vs. RHE and current density of 4.0 mA/cm(2) at 1600 rpm in alkaline condition. Additionally, as-prepared PMA/rGO-2 catalyst showed a single step similar to 4 electron transfer pathway similar to commercial Pt/C catalyst; confirmed through rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) study. Interestingly, PMA/rGO-2 electrocatalyst exhibited substantially higher stability than Pt/C catalyst even after 20K potential cycles (though the current density of former catalyst is inferior to later). Further, in a methanol cross-over test, PMA/rGO-2 was found to be inactive towards methanol oxidation reactions, which could nullify the issues due to the fuel cross-over effect, if employed as cathode in direct methanol fuel cells. The enhanced ORR activity and significant stability is attributable to the anchoring and homogenous distribution of polyoxomolybdate clusters on graphite oxide.

TI  - The dual capacity of the Ni-Sn alloy/MWCNT nanocomposite for sodium and hydrogen ions storage using porous Cu foam as a current collector
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A nanostructured Ni-Sn alloy/multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composite was successfully synthesized for highly reversible sodium and hydrogen ions storage by using an electrochemical deposition process on porous Cu foam. The surface morphology of the resulting Ni-Sn alloy/MWCNT nanocomposite was characterized using a field-emission scanning electron microscope, indicating the formation of sphere-like Ni-Sn alloy nano particles with an average size of 190 nm. On the other hand, X-ray diffraction analysis, energy dispersive and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopies were employed to determine the crystalline structure, elemental surface and chemical composition of the nano composite electrode. The initial sodium discharge capacity of the electrode was maximized at similar to 550 mAh g(-1) under the current density of 1000 mA g(-1), and a high hydrogen discharge capacity of 5200 mAh g(-1) was obtained at 1100 mA g(-1) after 20 cycles. A comprehensive comparison between the sodium and hydrogen ions capacities in this study and those of the literature for different materials and structures was also performed. Accordingly, the resulting nanocomposite electrode with dual capacity may offer promising applications in both sodium-ion battery and hydrogen storage. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Intercalating ionic liquid in graphene oxide to create efficient and stable anhydrous proton transfer highways for polymer electrolyte membrane
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Approaches for constructing efficient and stable proton transfer highways in polymer materials are urgently desirable and required for elevated-temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). Herein, ionic liquid intercalated GO (IGO) with acceptable fluidity is synthesized by a facile one-pot method and then utilized to construct anhydrous transfer highways in polymer-based composite membrane. The basic-imidazole-cationcontaining ionic liquid (IL) increases the flexibility of IGO and meanwhile reinforces the interaction with acidic sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) matrix, thus yielding more proportion of perpendicularly oriented IGO and the subsequent formation of 3-D cross-linked IGO networks. The IL molecules act as effective proton carrier sites along IGO networks, and in this way, efficient and long-range transfer highways for "bulk in plane" proton conduction are constructed. SP-(25I-GO)-10% achieves the maximum conductivity of 7.29 mS cm(-1) at 150 degrees C, 10 times higher than that of SPEEK control membrane. Meanwhile, the maximum current density and power density of SP-(25I-GO)-10% at 90 degrees C are 574.1 mA cm(-2) and 145.1 mW cm(-2), increased by 48% and 102% compared with that of SPEEK control membrane, respectively. Additionally, the nanoconfined effect of interlayer renders composite membrane enhanced IL retention ability through capillary force, consequently stable proton conduction and single cell behavior.

TI  - Platinum nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots: Enhanced electrocatalytic reduction of oxygen by nitrogen dopants
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs) prepared by hydrothermal treatment of citric acid and urea were used as an effective support for platinum nanoparticles synthesized by carbon monoxide reduction of Pt(IV) in water. TEM measurements showed that the platinum nanoparticles were 2.03 +/- 0.43 nm in diameter, and wrapped with one layer of NGQDs, as compared to results from AFM measurements. XPS measurements confirmed the formation of metallic platinum and the incorporation of nitrogen dopants within the graphitic molecular skeleton, and the shifts of Pt 4f binding energy suggested that charge transfer from Pt to NGQDs was facilitated by the more electronegative nitrogen dopants, as compared to platinum nanoparticle supported on undoped GQDs (Pt-GQDs). Because of this, the Pt-NGQDs nanocomposites showed markedly enhanced catalytic activity towards oxygen reduction reactions in alkaline media, as compared to Pt-GQDs, with a specific activity more than three times that of commercial Pt/C. Further comparison with NGQDs-supported gold nanoparticles showed that the platinum nanoparticles, rather than the NGQDs, played a dominant role in determining the ORR activity.

TI  - Dual gas sensing properties of graphene-Pd/SnO2 composites for H-2 and ethanol: Role of nanoparticles-graphene interface
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present work, role of palladium (Pd) and tin oxide (SnO2) nanoparticles (NPs) deposited on graphene has been investigated in terms of dual gas sensing characteristics of ethanol and H-2 between two temperatures. The incorporation of nanoparticles into graphene has been observed which results a large change in the sensing response towards these gases. It is investigated that, incorporation of isolated Pd NPs on the graphene facilitates the room temperature sensing of H-2 gas with fast response and recovery time whereas, isolated SnO2 NPs on graphene enables the detection of ethanol at 200 degrees C. However, combination of isolated Pd and SnO(2)NPs on graphene shows improved sensitivity and good selectivity towards H-2 and ethanol, usually not observed in chemiresistive gas sensors. Catalytic Pd-H interaction and corresponding change in work function of nanoparticles on hydrogenation resulting in modifications in electronic exchange between Pd, SnO2 and graphene are responsible for the observed behavior. These results are important for developing a new class of chemiresistive type gas sensor based on change in the electronic properties of the graphene and NPs interfaces.

TI  - Uniform cobalt nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene with abundant defects as high-performance bifunctional electrocatalyst in overall water splitting
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Co nanoparticles with uniform size (about 5 nm) embedded in N-doped graphene (Co-NG) were explored in this work. The introduction of a second carbon source of citric acid during synthesis prevented the Co atoms from growing up, thus regulating the size of the cobalt nanoparticles. N atoms in N-doped graphene had more lone-pair electrons, making it easier to capture electrons from hydrated ions, and facilitating the dynamics procedure of HER. Furthermore, N dopant rendered larger positive charge density on the adjacent carbon atoms, which was conducive to OER and HER. At 10 mA cm(-2) of the current density, the CoNG/CC catalyst's overvoltage of HER was 78 mV, approaching that of 20% Pt/C (59 mV), an efficient precious metal electrocatalyst for HER, while its overvoltage of OER was about 225 mV, 12.5% lower than that of RuO2 (257 mV, a common precious metal oxide OER electrocatalyst). In addition, this Co-NG/CC composite bifunctional catalyst displayed good electrochemical stability in alkali solution and might be designed as a dual-function catalyst in the application of overall water splitting. The cell voltage of Co-NG/CC//CoNG/CC was only 1.66 V, approaching to that of full precious metal cell of Pt/C//RuO2 (1.52 V), and revealing the good commercial application prospects of this composite bifunctional catalyst.

CL  - Rio de Janeiro, BRAZIL
AB  - Increasing Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells' (PEFCs) operating temperature has benefits on the performance and the ease of utilisation of the heat generated; however, efforts for high temperature PEFCs have resulted in high degradation and reduced life time. In the literature, conventional low temperature (T < 80 degrees C) and high temperature (140-200 degrees C) regimes have been extensively studied, while the gap of operating at intermediate temperature (IT) (100-120 degrees C) has been scarcely explored.The main bottleneck for operating at IT conditions is the development of a suitable proton exchange membrane with comparable performance and lifetime to the commercially used Nafion operating at conventional conditions. In this work, composite membranes of Graphene Oxide (GO) and Nafion of varied thickness were fabricated, characterised and assessed for in-situ single cell performance under automotive operating conditions at conventional and intermediate temperatures.The material characterisation confirmed that a composite GO-Nafion structure was achieved. The composite membrane demonstrated higher mechanical strength, enhanced water uptake, and higher performance. It was demonstrated that by utilising GO-Nafion composite membranes, an up to 20% increase in the maximum power density at all operating temperatures can be achieved, with the optimum performance is obtained at 100 degrees C. Moreover, the GO-Nafion membrane was able to maintain its open circuit voltage values at increased temperature and reduced thickness, indicating better durability and potentially higher lifetime.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploring cost-effective, high-efficiency and stable electrocatalysts for overall water splitting is greatly desirable and challenging for sustainable energy. Herein, a novel designed Ni activated molybdenum carbide nanoparticle loaded on stereotaxicallyconstructed graphene (SCG) using two steps facile strategy (hydrothermal and carbonization) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. The optimized Ni/ Mo2C(1:20)-SCG composites exhibit excellent performance with a low overpotential of 150 mV and 330 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution. In addition, when the optimized Ni/Mo2C(1:20)-SCG composite is used as a bifunctional electrode for overall water splitting, the electrochemical cell required a low cell voltage of 1.68 Vat a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and long-term stability of 24 h. More significantly, the synergetic effects between Ni-activated Mo2C nanoparticles and SCG are regarded as a significant contributor to accelerate charge transfer and promote electrocatalytic performance in hybrid electrocatalysts. Our works introduce a novel approach to design advanced bifunctional electrodes for overall water splitting. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Recent Progress on Metal Sulfide Composite Nanomaterials for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production
T2  - CATALYSTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Metal sulfide-based photocatalysts have gained much attention due to their outstanding photocatalytic properties. This review paper discusses recent developments on metal sulfide-based nanomaterials for H-2 production, acting as either photocatalysts or cocatalysts, especially in the last decade. Recent progress on key experimental parameters, in-situ characterization methods, and the performance of the metal sulfide photocatalysts are systematically discussed, including the forms of heterogeneous composite photocatalysts, immobilized photocatalysts, and magnetically separable photocatalysts. Some methods have been studied to solve the problem of rapid recombination of photoinduced carriers. The electronic density of photocatalysts can be investigated by in-situ C K-edge near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectra to study the mechanism of the photocatalytic process. The effects of crystal properties, nanostructure, cocatalyst, sacrificial agent, electrically conductive materials, doping, calcination, crystal size, and pH on the performance of composite photocatalysts are presented. Moreover, the facet effect and light trapping (or light harvesting) effect, which can improve the photocatalytic activity, are also discussed.

TI  - Graphene supported platinum nanoparticles as anode electrocatalyst for direct borohydride fuel cell
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The graphene supported Pt nanoparticles are prepared by ethylene glycol reduction method. The obtained Pt/graphene (Pt/G) nanocomposites are characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). TEM images show that the spherical Pt nanoparticles with sizes of 3.1 nm disperse uniformly on the surface of the graphene, which is consistent with the XRD date of 2.97 nm. The Pt/G nanocomposites show electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of 62.7 m(2)/g. It has been found by electrochemical measurements (i.e., cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry) that the Pt/G nanocomposites exhibit good electrocatalytic activity and stability toward borohydride oxidation. Besides, the Pt/G nanocomposites are used as anode electrocatalyst in a direct borohydride fuel cell at 298 K, and the maximum power density is 42 mW/cm(2), which is apparently higher than Vulcan XC-72R supported Pt (Pt/C) nanoparticles (34 mW/cm(2)).

TI  - Nanoporous Graphene via a Pressing Organization Calcination Strategy for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Generation
T2  - ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
M3  - Article
AB  - Nanoporous graphenes (NPGs) have recently attracted huge attention owing to their designable structures and diverse properties. Many important properties of NPGs are determined by their structural regularity and homogeneity. The mass production of NPGs with periodic well-defined pore structures under a solvent-free green synthesis poses a great challenge and is largely unexplored. A facile synthetic strategy of NPGs via pressing organization calcination (POC) of readily available halogenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is developed. The gram-scale synthesized NPGs have ordered structures and possess well-defined nanopores, which can be easily exfoliated to few layers and oxidized in controllable approaches. After being decorated with oxygen species, the oxidized NPGs with tunable catalytic centers exhibit high activity, selectivity, and stability toward electrochemical hydrogen peroxide generation.

TI  - Hydrogen production through glycerol steam reforming over beehive-biomimetic graphene-encapsulated nickel catalysts
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Graphene-encapsulated nickel catalysts were synthesized and attached to SiO2 skeleton, vividly described as "beehive-biomimetic catalysts". Rice husk char (RHC) served as the carbonaceous source in the synthesis. Different catalysts with nickel embedded inside graphene were tested in glycerol steam reforming (GSR) at 550, 600 and 650 degrees C. Catalysts were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy (Raman), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The effects of pretreating RHC or reaction temperature on yield of H-2, selectivity of gaseous products, and molar ratios of H-2/CO and CO/CO2 were investigated. The catalyst with acid-treated RHC as the carbon precursor exhibited better catalytic activity and durability in GSR. It delivered a higher H-2 yield of 5.09 mol H-2/mol glycerol and a higher H-2/CO ratio of 6.79 at 600 degrees C. The multilayered graphene prevented the oxidation, sintering, or acid corrosion of inner nickel without sacrificing its activity. The SiO2 skeleton also enhanced thermal stability of the catalyst.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the structural, morphological, and optical absorption of three separate perovskites (NaPbI3, CsPbI3, and LiPbI3) developed by a low-cost and massive hydrothermal production technique. For all samples, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement demonstrated the growth of perovskites in the hexagonal phase along (002) orientation. From the scanning electron microscope (SEM) analyses, the perovskites have mixed morphologies between nano/micro rods and nano/microdiscs. In the visible field, NaPbI3 demonstrated stronger light absorption than CsPbI3 and LiPbI3. The prepared perovskites were tested under visible light as working electrodes for water splitting reactions using Na2S2O3 electrolyte. With 2.76% at 405 nm, the NaPbI3 perovskite photoelectrode in accordance with its optical properties showed the highest incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) among the studied perovskites. Also, the NaPbI3 perovskite demonstrated higher PEC performance with an H-2 production rate of 38 mu molh(-1) cm(-2) than many other reported perovskites. The studied perovskites have high stability and reproductivity for the photoelectrochemical H-2 production.

AB  - Recently, effective hydrogen (H-2) evolution upon hydrolysis of different hydrogen storage materials has received much attention. Herein, graphene quantum dots-transition metal nanoparticles (GQDs-TMNPs), with high dispersibility and activity, have been successfully applied in the hydrolysis of both NH3BH3 (AB) and NaBH4 for the first time. GQDs-RhNPs, GQDs-RuNPs, and GQDs-PtNPs are very effective in the hydrolysis of AB and the turnover frequencies (TOFs) can achieve to as high as 656, 384, and 281 mol(H2)center dot mol(cat)(-1) min(-1), respectively. Moreover, the synergistic effect between GQDs and TMNPs is explored, and the mechanisms of catalytic hydrolysis of AB and NaBH4 by GQDs-TMNPs are proposed. This work not only paves the way for the development of GQDs-TMNPs nanocatalysts for the different hydrogen storage materials, but also further advances the understanding of the synergistic effects between GQDs and TMNPs.

TI  - Ultrathin Co3O4-Pt core-shell nanoparticles coupled with three-dimensional graphene for oxygen reduction reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Design and synthesis of platinum catalysts within atomic level are of great significance for the practical application of fuel cells. We found that the ultrathin Co(OH)(2) nanoparticles can be converted into Co3O4-Co core-shell nanostructures through a thermal annealing process in reducing atmosphere, which are uniformly distributed on the surface of 3D graphene (3DG). The Co3O4-Co core-shell nanoparticles have been successfully transformed into Co3O4-Pt core-shell nanoparticles via a controlled replacement reaction. The Co3O4-Pt @3DG contains only a few atomic layers of Pt shell, and presents a high Pt utilization nanostructure. Besides, the 3D graphene serves as a catalysts carrier with open structure, and offers a three-dimensional molecular accessibility and conducive to mass transfer. Significantly, the optimized mass activity and specific activity of 1.018 A/mgPt and 2.17 mA/cm(2) have been achieved on Co3O4-Pt @3DG at 0.9 V vs RHE, which are 7.6and 8.1 times higher than those of Pt/C (0.134 A/mgPt and 0.266 mA/cm(2)), respectively. The high activity is mainly attributed to the ultrathin core-shell structure with an ultrahigh Pt utilization, and the interaction between the near-surface Co3O4 and the surface Pt shell with a tensile strain to surface Pt shell, and the electrons transfer from Co to Pt.

TI  - Advanced Nano-Structured Materials for Photocatalytic Water Splitting
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The production of oxygen and hydrogen from solar water splitting has been considered to be an ultimate solution for energy and environmental issues, and over the past few years, nano-sized semiconducting metal oxides alone and with graphene have been shown to have great promise for use in photocatalytic water splitting. It is challenging to find ideal materials for photoelectrochemical water splitting, and these have limited commercial applicability due to critical factors, including their physico-chemical properties, the rate of charge-carrier recombination and limited light absorption. This review article discusses these main features, and recent research progress and major factors affect the performance of the water splitting reaction. The mechanism behind these interactions in transition metal oxides and graphene based nano-structured semiconductors upon illumination has been discussed in detail, and such characteristics are relevant to the design of materials with a superior photocatalytic response towards UV and visible light.

TI  - Encapsulated spinel CuXCo3-XO4 in carbon nanotubes as efficient and stable oxygen electrocatalysts
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of efficient, stable and cost-effective electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER), have become one of the most important bottlenecks in pursuing emerging renewable energy storage and environment friendliness technologies. In this study, we have successfully developed encapsulated CuXCo3-XO4 spinel nanocrystals in carbon nanotubes as high-performance bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst by one-step hydrothermal reaction. As compared with other Co-based materials, the resulting CuXCo3-XO4@C composite presents excellent catalytic performance and outstanding stability for both OER and ORR with ultralow overpotential (eta = 0.358 V) at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) and half-wave potential (E-1/2 = 0.82 V) in alkaline solution, respectively. The developed strategy to encapsulate spinel into carbon nanomaterials via a controllable pathway, may open new opportunities for the encapsulation structures of other catalysts.

TI  - Direct Hybridization of Noble Metal Nanostructures on 2D Metal-Organic Framework Nanosheets To Catalyze Hydrogen Evolution
T2  - NANO LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rational hybridization of two-dimensional (2D) nano materials with extrinsic species has shown great promise for a wide range of applications. To date, rational design and engineering of heterostructures based on 2D metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has been rather limited. Herein, we report an efficient strategy to construct noble metal/2D MOF heterostructures, featuring the utilization of surface oxygen sites from uncoordinated MOF ligands. The incorporation of highly dispersed noble metal nanoparticles (e.g., Pt and Pd) with modulated electronic structure is enabled on a surfactant-free MOF surface. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, the 2D Ni-MOF@Pt hybrid with well-defined interfaces is applied to boost the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and delivers decent electrocatalytic activity under both acidic and alkaline conditions. The present results are expected to provide new insights into furnishing MOFs with extended functionalities and applications.

AB  - Graphene/alpha-MnO2 nanocomposite cathodes containing various amount of alpha-MnO2 catalysts (10 wt.%, 30 wt.%, 50 wt.%) were produced using planetary ball milling. The charge-discharge characteristics of the Li-O-2 cells with composite cathodes have been investigated from 2.15 V to 4.35 Vat a constant current density of 0.1 mA cm(-2) with ECC-Air cells. In order to investigate lithium oxide formation and decomposition reactions on the Graphene/alpha-MnO2 cathode, cyclic voltammetry test was performed at a scan rate of 0.1 mV/s. The Li-O-2 cell with a Graphene/alpha-MnO2 nanocomposite cathode containing 50 wt.% alpha-MnO2 exhibited a 6000 mAhg(-1) discharge capacity at full discharge, 2500 mAhg(-1) stable specific capacity up to 10th cycle at the state of 10 h charge and discharge and a 1250 mAhg(-1) specific capacity until 25th cycle at the state of 5 h charge and discharge. This study demonstrated that Graphene/alpha-MnO2 nanocomposite cathodes on nickel foam might be a good alternative cathode material for Li-O-2 batteries in the future.

TI  - Z-scheme heterojunction ZnSnO3/rGO/MoS2 nanocomposite for excellent photocatalytic activity towards mixed dye degradation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, a novel (ZnSnO3/rGO/MoS2) nanocomposite was prepared and its photocatalytic performances were investigated. The synthesised ZnSnO3 spheres were well dispersed over the surface of rGO sheet and MoS2 layers (ZSGM). The structural, morphological and elemental properties of the composites were examined by XRD, SEM, HRTEM and EDS. The surface chemical composition and functional groups of the elements interlinked in the composites were identified from XPS and FTIR analysis. BET and Raman analysis indicate the effective formation between MoS2/rGO/ZnSnO3 ternary heterostructure nanocomposite. The suppressed photogenic charge carrier's recombination rate was investigated by PL analysis. From UV analysis, the bandgap of ZSGM nanocomposite was successfully tuned from 3.13 eV to 2.70 eV, leading to high photocatalytic performance by mixed dye pollutant under UV-visible light illumination. The ZSGM photocatalyst achieved highest removal rate of 0.0131 min(-1) for Rh B degradation, and 0.0153 min(-1) for MB dye degradation and efficiency was 78% (Rh B) and 86% (MB), respectively in 100 min, which shows dramatically enhanced activity than other samples. In the presence of rGO/MoS2 in ZS, ZSGM photocatalysts exhibit higher catalytic activity due to a lower bandgap, more absorption in the visible region, and suppressed recombination rate of photogenerated e(-)/h(+) pairs.

TI  - A non-noble, low cost, multicomponent electrocatalyst based on nickel oxide decorated AC nanosheets and PPy nanowires for the direct methanol oxidation reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The multicomponent electrocatalyst is a low-cost composite material exhibiting excellent catalytic activity suitable for methanol oxidation reactions (MOR). In this work, we report a glassy carbon electrode modified nickel oxide nanospheres (NiO) decorated biomass-derived activated carbon (AC) nanosheets and polypyrrole (PPy) nanowire, electrocatalyst (NiO_AC@PPy/CCE) for direct methanol oxidation fuel cell (DMFC) application. The SEM micrographs reveal the nanosheets and nanowire-like morphology of AC and PPy decorated with NiO nanospheres which provide a high surface area with electrocatalytic activity, and stability for MOR. The NiO_AC@PPy/CCE exhibits a high current density of 551 mA/mg at a low onset potential of 0.5 V (vs AglAgCl) towards electro-oxidation of 0.5 M methanol (MeOH) in an alkaline medium. This superior performance of the NiO_AC@PPy/GCE over other reported metal-oxides based electrocatalysts is attributed to the synergistic effect of the NiO_AC@PPy electrocatalyst, wherein NiO provides electrocatalytic active sites for MOR via Ni2+/Ni3+ redox couple while the PPy and AC contribute towards the chemical stability and electrical conductivity of the electrode, respectively. The electrode shows 79% of capacity retention after 10,000 s of chronoamperometry displaying excellent chemical stability with reduced effect of CO intermediate poisoning at the electrode surface. This excellent stability and overall performance of the NiO_AC@PPy proves it as an ideal, low-cost non-noble electrocatalyst for DMFCs. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Sulfonated poly(arylene ether nitrile)-based hybrid membranes containing amine-functionalized GO for constructing long-range ionic nanochannels
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To simultaneously balance proton conduction and methanol diffusion, the acid-base hybrid membranes based on sulfonated poly(arylene ether nitrile) (SPEN) with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane functionalized graphene oxide (NGO) are prepared by solution-casting method. The loading of NGO is varied to explore the influence on cross-sectional morphology, dimensional stability, proton conductivity and methanol permeability of composite membranes. In this way, the interfacial ionic nanochannels are established at the interface of NGO and SPEN, constructing the long-range ionic nano channels to provide fast proton transfer. Meanwhile, the formation of more zigzag transportation channels could effectively prevent methanol diffusion. The improved properties of the composite membranes can be attributed to the excellent interfacial interactions induced by acid-base and hydrogen bonding interactions. The composite membrane with 1 wt% NGO shows high proton conductivity (0.104 S.cm(-1) at 20 degrees C) and low methanol permeability (1.74 x 10(-7) cm(2).s(-1) at 20 degrees C), exhibiting higher selectivity (5.977 x 10(5) S cm(-3)s) compared with pure SPEN and Nafion 117 membranes. Therefore, it will provide a feasible pathway to conquer the trade-off effect between proton conductivity and methanol resistance for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC) applications.

AB  - In this experimental work, a green biosynthesize method was used to synthesis of ZnAl2O4 nanoparticles. To synthesis of the ZnAl2O4 spinel, beside the Zn2+ and Al3+ sources, olive leaf and green tea extracts were used as reagents. The Electrochemical hydrogen storage performance of ZnAl2O4 synthesized via olive leaf and green tea extracts were compared via chronopotentiometry method in aqueous KOH electrolyte, for first time. The hydrogen storage capacity of ZnAl2O4 spinel enhanced by synthesize nanocomposite of ZnAl2O4 with graphene nanosheet. Also, different analysis were served to study the products structure, composition and morphologies. The porous structure of samples was investigated by BET analysis. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were used to investigate the phase and purity of the synthesized nanostructures. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was used to obtaine the chemical compositions of the nanostructures and also to approve the XRD results. To further study the chemical composition of the products, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis was served. The products size and morphology was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. The results showed that the reagents specially olive leaf and green tea extracts had significant role in product size and morphology. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - High-throughput Production of ZnO-MoS2-Graphene Heterostructures for Highly Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution
T2  - MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - High-throughput production of highly efficient photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution remains a considerable challenge for materials scientists. Here, we produced extremely uniform high-quality graphene and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanoplatelets through the electrochemical-assisted liquid-phase exfoliation, out of which we subsequently fabricated MoS2/graphene van der Waals heterostructures. Ultimately, zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles were deposited into these two-dimensional heterostructures to produce an artificial ZnO/MoS2/graphene nanocomposite. This new composite experimentally exhibited an excellent photocatalytic efficiency in hydrogen evolution under the sunlight illumination (A > 400 nm), owing to the extremely high electron mobilities in graphene nanoplatelets and the significant visible-light absorptions of MoS2. Moreover, due to the synergistic effects in MoS2 and graphene, the lifetime of excited carriers increased dramatically, which considerably improved the photocatalytic efficiency of the ZnO/MoS2/graphene heterostructure. We conclude that the novel artificial heterostructure presented here shows great potential for the high-efficient photocatalytic hydrogen generation and the high throughput production of visible-light photocatalysts for industrial applications.

TI  - Development of ternary Pd-Co-Ir metal nanoparticles decorated on graphene-CNTs hybrid support: An efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen production from methanol reformation
T2  - ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most effective methods for onsite hydrogen production has been identified as electrochemical methanol reformation (ECMR). However, when it comes to economic viability, it is critical to reduce production costs while improving the specific performance and stability of the electrocatalyst towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). To address these issues, we have synthesized Pd2-Co1-Ir1 alloy nanoparticles which were then assembled onto graphene-carbon nanotubes (G-CNTs) through the chemical reduction method. The electro-catalytic activity of the developed electrocatalyst for HER was evaluated through CV, LSV and EIS techniques in an acidic medium. The Pd2-Co1-Ir1/G-CNTs hybrid catalyst showed excellent electrocatalytic activity with high electrochemical surface area (160 m2 g-1), small Tafel slope value (31 mV dec- 1), low charge transfer resistance (9 omega) and long-term stability. Pd2-Co1-Ir1/G-CNTs electrocatalyst showed superior performance at 60 degrees C cell temperature with a cell voltage and current density of 0.60 V and 250 mA cm-2, respectively, in single ECMR cell as compared to commercially available Pt/C catalyst and other control catalysts in a single ECMR cell. The improvement in electrocatalytic activity could be attributed to the use of G-CNTs as hybrid carbon support and alloying Pd with Co and Ir, which in turn enhanced the electrocatalytic activity of Pd metal.

AB  - A novel and simple synthesis method of preparing ethylene diamine (ED) functionalized graphene (ED-Gh) decorated with Pt nanoparticle has been reported. Morphology, microstructure of the resulted material was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy (Raman), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Electrochemical studies to-ward formic acid electrooxidation were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA). These results showed that Pt nanoparticle with the crystallite size of about 5 nm was highly dispersed on ED-Gh and the catalyst exhibited good electro-catalytic activity and long-term stability. Therefore, ED-Gh can be a potential support for Pt in direct formic acid fuel cells. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Electrochemical water splitting plays an important role in alternative energy studies, since it is highly efficient and environment-friendly. Accordingly, it is an ideal way of providing alternative to meet the urgent need of finding sustainable and clean energy. This study presents the fabrication of CoP attached on multilevel N-doped CNT/graphene (CoP-CNT/NG) hybrids. The multilevel carbon structure can enhance electrical conductivity efficiently and increase the reaction active area immensely. The obtained electrocatalyst exhibits great electronic conductivity (17.8 s cm(-1)) and HER activity with low overpotential (155 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)), low Tafel slope (69.1 mV dec(-1)) in 0.5 M H2SO4.

TI  - Palladium nanoparticles supported on graphene as an efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A nanocomposite with Pd nanoparticles deposited on graphene is prepared through a facile and low cost approach. The Pd-graphene nanocomposite was easily synthesized using dip coating method on glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The resulting Pd-graphene nanocomposite was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). SEM indicates the formation of Pd nanoparticles with sizes in the range of 40-80 nm on graphene. Also, the behavior of as-prepared Pd-graphene nanocomposite as electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was investigated by cyclic voltammetry in 0.5 M H2SO4. Pd-graphene nanocomposite shows an enhanced catalytic activity toward HER than Pd and graphene. These results demonstrate that graphene is an excellent support material for Pd nanoparticles. It was observed that the current density of Pd-graphene nanocomposite had a little decrease after continues 500 cycling, which shows the catalyst presents high stability in the recycling process. Furthermore, the chronoamperometric method confirmed that the fabricated catalyst has good stability for HER. The good catalytic activity suggests that the Pd-graphene nanocomposite can be a promising electrocatalyst in hydrogen production process. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

TI  - Constructing g-C3N4 quantum dots modified g-C3N4/GO nanosheet aerogel for UV-Vis-NIR driven highly efficient photocatalytic H-2 production
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of ultraviolet to near-infrared (UV-Vis-NIR) responsive photocatalysts offers a unique opportunity for the full use of solar energy to solve the energy and the environmental problems. Here, successful preparation of a three-dimensional (3D) porous photocatalyst of graphitic carbon nitride quantum dot (CNQDs) modified g-C3N4/graphene oxide composite aerogel (CNGO/CNQDs) via hydrothermal and vacuum injection method was reported. In this unique ternary 3D photocatalyst, graphene oxide could improve the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes and promote the charge separation, while the aerogel's 3D network structure provided a rich active site. Simultaneously, due to the appropriate up-conversion performance of the nitrogen carbide quantum dots, CNGO/ CNQDs achieved a light response from ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (NIR). These properties endow it with a good photocatalytic performance. The hydrogen production efficiency of CNGO/CNQDs reached 1231 mu mol h(-1), which was 16 times more than that of matrix material. In addition, the apparent quantum yields (AQY) of CNGO/CNQDs at wavelengths of 420 nm and 700 nm were 13% and 0.116%, respectively. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Enhanced hydrogen storage performance of three-dimensional hierarchical porous graphene with nickel nanoparticles
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Three-dimensional hierarchical porous graphene with nickel nanoparticles (3DHPG-Ni) was synthesized through electrostatic assembly method with the assistance of poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) template and subsequent removal of PMMA template by calcination. The morphology, microstructure and hydrogen adsorption properties of 3DHPG-Ni nanocomposites were examined in detail. The obtained 3DHPG-Ni nano composite exhibited hierarchical porous structure composed of macro-, meso- and micropores, high specific surface area (925 m(2) g(-1)), large pore volume (0.58 cm(3) g(-1)) and excellent hydrogen storage capacity. Under the pressure of 5 bar, 3DHPG-Ni nano composite showed a maximum hydrogen capacity of 4.22 wt% and 1.95 wt% at 77 K and 298 K, respectively, demonstrating that the as-prepared 3DHPG-Ni nanocomposite was supposed to be a promising material with outstanding properties for practical applications in the field of hydrogen storage. The three-dimensional hierarchical porous structure, evenly distributed Ni nanoparticles and hydrogen spillover effect were responsible for the enhanced hydrogen storage capacities.

TI  - 3D-functionalized carbon nanotube microsphere networks modified by 1-aminopyrene promote silicon anode with an enhanced cyclic performance for Li-ion batteries
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although silicon has higher theoretical specific capacity to meet the demand for higher energy density, its large volume expansion and low conductivity make the practical application of silicon anode difficult in the field of lithium-ion batteries. In this work, Si@(AP-AOCNTs) composites with uniform conductive network and pore structure are prepared by spray drying method. In the composite microspheres, silicon particles are embedded into the 3D interwoven network of 1-aminopyrene modified oxidized carbon nanotubes, which can not only buffer the volume expansion of silicon, but also ensure the effective transport of electrons and ions. This is demonstrated by the remarkable cycle life, and the electrode still has a reversible specific capacity of 939.3mAh/g after 975 cycles at 0.5A/g. Moreover, 97.3% of the initial capacity (at 0.5A/g) is still retained after the rate cycling, when the current density returns to 0.5A/g. (C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

CP  - 7th Symposium on Hydrogen, Fuel Cells and Advanced Batteries (HYCELTEC)
CL  - Barcelona, SPAIN
AB  - High performing and cost effective nanocomposite membranes for DMFC application are synthesized by incorporating hygroscopic layered double hydroxides (LDH) particles into sulfonated polysulfone (sPSU). A significant improvement in the dimensional stability as well as in the water and methanol molecular dynamics of the sPSU_LDH composite membrane is observed in comparison with both pristine sPSU and Nafion 212. The strong electrostatic interaction occurring between positively charged LDH platelets and negatively charged polymer chains of sPSU alters the microstructure of the ionic domains, allowing an effective reduction of the methanol permeability whilst improving the proton conductivity. The methanol crossover measurements confirmed that sPSU_LDH membranes are able to withstand high methanol concentration without significant aftermath on the chemical stability of the electrolyte. The features enable the single DMFC assembled with the sPSU_LDH nanocomposite to achieve the remarkable power density of 150 mW cm(-2) at 80 degrees C in 5 M methanol solution.

TI  - Pt-Pd nanoparticles supported on sulfonated nitrogen sulfur co-doped graphene for methanol electro-oxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, sulfonated nitrogen sulfur co-doped graphene (S-NS-GR) nanocomposite, i.e., nitrogen sulfur co-doped graphene functionalized with -SO3H group as a novel catalyst support material was prepared. Pt-Pd nanoparticles (Pt-Pd NPs) were deposited on the surface of S-NS-GR by a facile electrochemical approach. The morphology and structure of Pd-PtNPs/S-NS-GR were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), respectively. In addition, the electrocatalytic performance of catalyst for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) was systematically studied by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry in alkaline media. Compared with Pt-Pd NPs supported on nitrogen sulfur co-doped graphene (Pt-PdNPs/NS-GR), the excellent performance of Pd-PtNPs/S-NS-GR is mainly ascribed to the embedding of abundant functional groups (-SO3H) into the NS-GR layers, which not only facilitate the homogeneous distribution of metal NPs, but also strengthen the interaction between metals and support material, thus improve the stability of catalyst in MOR.

AB  - Fuel cells are the promising new non-conventional power source for vehicles as well as portable devices. Direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) is especially attractive since it uses low cost liquid methanol as a fuel. Proton exchange membrane is one of the most crucial part of DMFC. Herein, we synthesized the sulfonated boron nitride (SBN) based SPEEK composite membranes for the DMFC application. SBN was synthesized by covalent function-alization of hydroxylated BN by using 3-mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane and sulfonated by subsequent oxidation of mercapto group. Sulfonated poly (ether ether ketone) is used as a polymer matrix for SBN. With well controlled content of SBN into SPEEK matrix exhibit high proton conductivity, IEC and water content along with excellent mechanical strength. Composite membranes show low methanol cross over and high selectivity, which makes them attractive candidate for proton exchange membrane for direct methanol fuel cells.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY

AB  - Establishing non-precious metals with high efficiency for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysis are extremely essential for renewable energy technologies. Herein, we achieve the synthesis of metal-organic framework precursor of Cu[Fe(CN)(6)]center dot XH2O cube at room temperature, which further derived ferric oxide@cupric oxide alloy ball. On this foundation, we creatively synthesized ferric oxide@cupric oxide alloy ball on nitrogen-doped graphene (NG@Fe2O3/CuO alloy ball), where Fe2O3/CuO alloy ball is evenly anchored on nitrogen-doped graphene. It is worth noting that nitrogen doping, reduction of graphene oxide and conversion of Cu[Fe(CN)(6)]center dot XH2O cube precursor into Fe2O3/CuO alloy ball can be simultaneously realized by facile one-step calcination. Moreover, synergistic effect between the nitrogen-doped graphene and Fe2O3/CuO alloy ball can enhance the overall electrocatalytic performance of the catalyst by playing specific roles. The outstanding catalytic activity, long-term durability and stability make NG@Fe2O3/CuO alloy ball to become a promising non-precious electrocatalyst for electrochemical water oxidation.

AB  - Highly dispersed nanoparticles (NPs) of Cu, Ag and their composites are obtained on nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheets (N-GNS) using a microwave-assisted polyol reduction method. Structural, electrochemical and electrocatalytic surface characterization of materials have been carried out by TEM, XRD, XPS, cyclic (CV) and linear sweep (LSV) voltammetries. The study shows that the crystallites of the Cu-Ag composite follow the face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure. Further, the catalytic activities of Cu/N-GNS and Ag/N-GNS towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are greatly enhanced when Cu and Ag are dispersed on the N-GNS surface in 1:2.9 M ratio. The active composite material does not oxidize methanol practically and has outstanding stability under ORR condition.(C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - ACTA PHYSICO-CHIMICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Nanosheet materials obtained from laminar compounds are new two-dimensional anisotropic nanomaterials that can even reach the sub-nanometer scale. These materials possess unique physical and chemical properties. An example of such a nanosheet materials is graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets transformed from bulk g-C3N4. Here, g-C3N4 nanosheets were prepared from bulk g-C3N4 by high-temperature thermal oxidation. The photocatalytic activity of eosin (EY)-sensitized g-C3N4 nanosheets for hydrogen evolution was about 2.6 times higher than that of bulk g-C3N4. The structure of the g-C3N4 nanosheets and process of electron transfer between EY and the g-C3N4 nanosheets were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis, fluorescence spectroscopy, and photoelectrochemical measurements. The g-C3N4 nanosheets possessed high specific surface area. The g-C3N4 nanosheets not only effectively absorbed dye molecules, but also enhanced the separation and electron transport efficiencies of photogenerated charges because of their quantum confinement effect. The quantum confinement effect of g-C3N4 nanosheets widened their bandgap, improved electron transfer ability along the in-plane direction, and lengthened the lifetime of photoexcited charge carriers. As a result, the photocatalytic activity of the g-C3N4 nanosheets was improved compared with that of bulk g-C3N4.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A facile one-pot reduction process is used to obtain the cobalt/graphene composite (CoRGO). The CoRGO materials exhibit unique reticular globular morphology. Co(9)S(8)hydrogen storage alloy is fabricated via mechanical alloying method. Different amounts of CoRGO are coated on the surface of Co(9)S(8)alloy by ball milling. The electrochemical characterizations of the composites are conducted in the standard tri-electrode system. Ultimately, the CoRGO coated Co(9)S(8)electrode shows preferable performance than the RGO modified alloy (603.6 mAh/g) and original alloy (577.3 mAh/g). As the additive content of CoRGO is 6 wt%, a maximum discharge capacity of 637.5 mAh/g is obtained. Furthermore, the cycle stability and high-rate dischargeability of the electrode are also enhanced. The Co particles in the CoRGO participate in the reversible redox reactions and the graphene provides high conductivity. The CoRGO with distinctive structure and morphology can not only improve the electrocatalytic activity but also increase the specific surface area of Co(9)S(8)alloy. The cobalt and graphene species in the CoRGO composite serve a synergistic effect in further facilitating the hydrogen diffusion, expediting the charge transfer in/on the alloy and improving the corrosion resistance, thus enhancing the electrochemical performance and reaction kinetics of Co(9)S(8)alloy.

M3  - Article
AB  - Hybrid nanostructures composed of vertical graphene nanosheet (VGNS) and MoS2 nano-leaves are synthesized by the chemical vapor deposition method followed by a solvothermal process. The unique three-dimensional nanostructures of MoS2/VGNS arranged in a vertically aligned manner can be easily constructed on various substrates, including Ni foam and graphite paper. Compared with MoS2/carbon black, MoS2/VGNS nanocomposites grown on Ni foam exhibit enhanced electrochemical performance as the anode material of lithium-ion batteries, delivering a specific capacity of 1277 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 100 mAh g(-1) and a high first-cycle coulombic efficiency of 76.6%. Moreover, the MoS2/VGNS nanostructures also retain a capacity of 1109 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g(-1), suggesting excellent cycling stability. In addition, when the MoS2/VGNS nanocomposites grown on graphite paper are applied in the hydrogen evolution reaction, a small Tafel slope of 41.3 mV dec(-1) and a large double-layer capacitance of 7.96 mF cm(-2) are obtained, which are among the best values achievable by MoS2-based hybrid structures. These results demonstrate the potential applications of MoS2/VGNS hybrid materials for energy conversion and storage and may open up a new avenue for the development of vertically aligned, multifunctional nanoarchitectures.

TI  - Reliability of hydrogen sensing based on bimetallic Ni-Pd/graphene composites
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Graphene-supported nickel palladium (Ni-Pd) bimetallic nanoparticles (Ni-Pd/Gr) were synthesized using a simple chemical method, followed by a post-thermal annealing process. The characteristics of resistivity-type hydrogen (H-2) sensors composed of Pd-Gr composites (with small amounts of Ni added to the Pd nanoparticles (Pd NPs)) were investigated in detail. Pd NPs with various amounts of Ni embedded into the Pd lattice were synthesized by varying the molar ratios of the Ni/Pd precursors. The results from this work indicate that the addition of Ni not only enhances performance, but also reduces the hysteresis behavior of the Pd Gr composite based H-2 sensors. H-2 was detectable from 1 to 1000 ppm based on a rapid recovery response with suitable Ni/Pd percentages. At the optimal Ni/Pd percentage of 7% (Ni/Pd similar to 7%), sensors showed a small enhancement of sensitivity, fast recovery, and minimum hysteresis effect. From our experiment, the addition of Ni to Pd NPs results in a reduction of the hysteresis effect and reliability on H2 sensors based on Pd Gr composites.

TI  - Effect of Nickel Precursor on the Catalytic Performance of Graphene Aerogel-Supported Nickel Nanoparticles for the Production of COx-free Hydrogen by Ammonia Decomposition
T2  - ENERGY TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Graphene aerogel (GA), a promising porous material with high specific surface area and electrical conductivity, is utilized to disperse nickel nanoparticles to reach high catalytic activity in COx-free hydrogen production from ammonia. Ni(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O and Ni (II) acetylacetonate (Ni(acac)(2)) were considered as metal precursors and the pH of the impregnation solution was varied to investigate the effects on the catalytic properties of the GA-supported nickel catalysts. Data showed that the best dispersion and homogeneity, as well as the catalytic performance, is achieved with Ni(acac)(2). An average Ni nanoparticle size of 13.6 +/- 4.3 nm was obtained on the GA-supported catalyst prepared by using Ni(acac)(2) dissolved in an impregnation solution with a pH of 10.2. This catalyst with a Ni loading of 11.1 wt% provided an ammonia conversion of 70.2% at a space velocity of 30 000 mL NH3 g(cat)(-1) h(-1) and 600 degrees C corresponding to a hydrogen production rate of 21.5 mmol H-2 g(cat)(-1) min(-1). Data illustrated that the difference between the point of zero charge of the support and the pH of the impregnation solution set by the type of the Ni precursor is a major parameter controlling the metal dispersion and the consequent catalytic activity.

TI  - Oxygen reduction catalyzed by nanocomposites based on graphene quantum dots-supported copper nanoparticles
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nanocomposites based on graphene quantum dots (GQDs)-supported copper nanoparticles were prepared by thermal refluxing of copper salts in 1,2-propanediol at 140 degrees C in the presence of GQDs. Transmission electron microscopic measurements showed that the resulting Cu/GQD nanoparticles increased from 5 to 15 nm in average diameter with increasing metal loadings. Raman spectroscopic measurements showed that all nano composites exhibited well-defined D and G vibrational bands. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies indicated the formation of Cu2O and CuO in the nanocomposite particles, along with various defect concentrations within the GQD graphitic skeletons. Electrochemical studies showed that the nanocomposites exhibited apparent electrocatalytic activity in oxygen reduction in alkaline media, and the sample with a Cu/C atomic ratio of 2.88% exhibited the best ORB. activity among the series, within the context of onset potential, number of electron transfer and kinetic current density. The performance was further improved by deliberate hydrothermal treatments of the sample, and 160 degrees C was identified as the optimal temperature, which was ascribed to manipulation of the electronic interactions between copper nanoparticles and oxygen intermediates by the GQD structural defects.

TI  - Bio-inspired graphene foam decorated with Pt nanoparticles for hydrogen storage at room temperature
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A bioinspired hydrogen storage medium uses polydopamine (PD) which acts as a reducing agent, functionalizer, and strong metal binder. By controlling the degree of functionalized PD on graphene, the specific surface area of three-dimensionally interconnected graphene foam can be controlled. In addition, the functionalization degree of PD affects the size, distribution, and amount of platinum (Pt) nanoparticles decorated on the foam. By combining a high surface area and a uniform distribution of small sized Pt nanoparticles, the Pt-decorated PD-functionalized graphene (rGO/PD_Pt) exhibits a high hydrogen storage capacity of 3.19 wt.% at room temperature and 100 bar, which is the best hydrogen storage medium exhibiting the highest hydrogen uptake per unit specific surface area.

TI  - Improved de/re-hydrogenation properties of MgH2 catalyzed by graphene templated Ti-Ni-Fe nanoparticles
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present investigation deals with the excellent catalytic effect of graphene templated Ti -Ni-Fe nanoparticles (TieNieFe@Gr) on de/re-hydrogenation characteristics of MgH2. The catalytic effect of TieNieFe@Gr on MgH2 has also been compared with Ti@Gr, Ni@Gr, and Fe@Gr. It has been found that Ti-Ni-Fe@Gr lowers the onset desorption temperature up to 252 degrees C with improved kinetics and cyclability for the hydrogen release and absorption from MgH2. The presence of a multivalence environment around Mg/MgH2 has been analyzed by XPS analysis which gives the evidence of possible electronic exchange between the catalyst and Mg/MgH2 during de-/rehydrogenation. Since Mg/MgH2 and TieNieFe are both anchored on graphene template, agglomeration detrimental to cycling is not possible. Thus negligible degradation of 0.22 wt% has been observed even after 24 cycles of de/rehydrogenation. (C) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Graphene, is a carbon allotrope, which is widely used as a substrate for various catalysts due to its interesting physicochemical properties. In the present study, graphene oxide sheets were prepared from graphite, then, the graphene oxide surface was modified by a low-temperature method using sulfur and copper atoms to obtain pseudo-enzyme Cu/S/Graphene prosthetic group. The current density passing through Cu/S/Graphene catalyst was four times higher than that passing through graphite. The novel copper-based catalyst had an extraordinary performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to the unique bio-inspired and stoichiometric structure. The results of Raman and Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirmed the presence of ultra-low content of copper (2%) and sulfur (1%) atoms on the graphene surface. Thermogravimetric analysis indicated a strong interaction between nanoparticles and graphene layers. The number of electrons transferred for ORR varied from 3.98 to 4.16 in a wide range of over-potentials indicating an effective 4-electron pathway form O-2 to H2O. The Tafel slopes indicated insignificant amount of formed copper oxide on the catalyst surface. The catalyst showed excellent electrochemical durability and its half-wave potential (E-1/2) was exhibited a negative shift only 8.2 mV after 10000 cycles. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

CP  - 7th European Fuel Cell Technology and Applications (EFC) Piero Lunghi Conference and Exhibition
CL  - Naples, ITALY
AB  - In the present work, nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon nanosheets (NMCNs) are prepared and extensively investigated for the oxygen reduction reaction. Initially, by using dual templates, viz. graphene oxide and a cationic surfactant, silica films (thickness: 1.0 nm) are synthesized and characterized using transmission electron microscope (TEM), nitrogen adsorption-desorption (N-2 ad/des) measurements, and small-angle X-ray diffraction (SA-XRD).Morphology and structure of silica evolve along with graphene oxide concentration, while the co-operative assembly and the final structure are determined by the electrostatic interaction between the dual templates. The effect of silica template on the resultant NMCNs is investigated physicochemically by photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), TEM, N-2 ad/des and electrochemically by cyclic voltammetry (CV), and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV).NMCNs are featured of a high content of nitrogen dopant, high specific surface area (SSA) and ultrathin thickness (1.5 nm), favoring catalysis and facilitating the mass transport of the reactive species. From the electrochemical tests, it is confirmed that NMCNs yield a high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalytic activity in acid and alkaline environment; this activity is similar or even better as compared with the one measured over carbon supported platinum commercial catalyst (40 wt % Pt/C).

AB  - Monodisperse ruthenium (Ru) nanoparticles (NPs) supported on graphene have been synthesized by co-reduction of RuCl3 and graphite oxide in ethylene glycol using ascorbic acid as reducing agents. Thanks to the narrow size distribution of Ru NPs and the synergistic effect with graphene, the as-synthesized Ru/graphene exerts exceedingly high catalytic activity toward hydrogen generation from hydrolysis of ammonia borane, with the turnover frequency (TOP) value of 600 mol H-2 Min(-1) (mol Ru)(-1), which is among the highest value ever reported.

AB  - Monodisperse trimetallic CoAgPd alloy nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized by a controlled co-reduction of cobalt (II) acetylacetonate, silver nitrate and palladium acetylacetonate in oleylamine at 90 degrees C using 2-methylpyridine borane as the reducing agents. This is the first time using amine borane as the reducing agent to synthesize non-noble metal contained monodisperse trimetallic alloy NPs at relatively low temperature. The 2.8 nm monodisperse CoAgPd NPs were further assembled on graphene by a simple solution-phase self-assembly method, and tested for catalytic dehydrogenation of formic acid at room temperature. Unexpectedly, the introducing of small amount of cobalt can significantly enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

TI  - Ultra-small RuPx nanoparticles on graphene supported schiff-based networks for all pH hydrogen evolution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As a promising candidate to replace Pt in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), ruthenium phosphide catalysts have shown excellent performance and attract increasing attention. However, it is still a challenge to control the particle sizes of RuPx were on the supports. In this study, the Schiff-based networks with 3D rigid organic networks are successfully grown on graphene, and the obtained composite was used as a new support for the RuPx. This composite can not only provide more metal coordinating sites but also restrict the growth of RuPx. Therefore, ultra-small RuPx nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed via a subsequent phosphating and pyrolysis process. The final RuPx/JNPG catalyst exhibits low overpotentials at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (32 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, 13 mV in 1 M KOH solution, and 50 my in 1 M PBS solution). This work provides a new strategy to solve the aggregation problem of the metal phosphides on the substrate by introducing Schiff-based networks into the graphene.

TI  - Facile synthesis of triangular shaped palladium nanoparticles decorated nitrogen doped graphene and their catalytic study for renewable energy applications
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We report a novel method for the synthesis of triangular shaped palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) decorated nitrogen doped graphene. Nitrogen doped graphene (N-G) is synthesized by uniform coating of polyelectrolyte modified graphene surface with a nitrogen containing polymer followed by their pyrolysis. The triangular shaped Pd NPs are decorated over nitrogen doped graphene (Pd/N-G) by kinetically controlling the polyol reduction process. The kinetic control of the growth of the nanoparticles and nitrogen doping of the supporting material leads to the formation of highly dispersed anisotropic nanoparticles over the graphene support. Hydrogen storage study of N-G and Pd/N-G give a storage capacity of 1.1 wt% and 1.9 wt%, respectively at 25 degrees C and 2 MPa hydrogen equilibrium pressure. Electrocatalytic study of Pd/N-G shows that it is a very good electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction and highly stable in acidic media due to the strong binding between Pd NPs and graphene support as a result of nitrogen doping besides has high methanol tolerance in acidic media. The present synthesis procedure highlights a new pathway for the highly dispersed and different morphological metal nanoparticles decorated graphene composites for energy related applications.

TI  - Enhanced bioelectricity generation and cathodic oxygen reduction of air breathing microbial fuel cells based on MoS2 decorated carbon nanotube
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing efforts have been devoted to enhancing the cathode activity towards oxygen reduction and improve power generation of air breathing microbial fuel cells. Exploring non-precious metal and highly active cathodic catalyst plays a key role in improving cathode performance. Our work aims to investigate the electrocatalyst behavior and power output of the single-chamber MFC equipped with carbon nanotubes hybridized molybdenum disulfide nanocomposites (CNT/MoS2) cathode. MoS2 nanosheets embedded into the CNTs network structure is synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method. The CNT/MoS2-MFC achieves a maximum power density of 53.0 mW m(-2), which is much higher than those MFCs with pure CNTs (21.4 mW m(-2)) or solely MoS2 (14.4 mW m(-2)) cathode. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) test also demonstrates a promoted electrocatalytic activity of synthesized material, which may be attributed to the special interlaced structure and abundant oxygen chemisorption sites of CNT/MoS2. Such CNTs-based noble-metal-free catalyst presents a new approach to the application of MFCs cathode materials. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work reports the synthesis of a new matrix material (graphene-supported NiCl2 and CoCl2 nanoparticles) for loading ammonia borane (AB) and investigates their catalysis effect for dehydrogenation properties. The NiCl2 and CoCl2 nanoparticles are obtained with the size around 3-10 nm and dispersed uniformly on the surface of graphene, which exhibit enhanced catalysis effect for the dehydrogenation of AB. The AB@NiCl2/CoCl2-graphene system, obtained via loading AB on the NiCl2/CoCl2-graphene scaffold, shows much lower onset dehydrogenation temperature of 60-90 degrees C and effective suppression of those byproducts such as ammonia, diborane and borazine formations compared with pristine AB. Meanwhile, the activation energy of AB@NiCl2/CoCl2-graphene has been calculated to explore the improvement of dehydrogenation kinetics of AB under the existence of graphene-supported NiCl2 or CoCl2 nanoparticles.

AB  - Easy synthesis of graphene based composite photocatalyst with the incorporation of minimal quantity of noble metals for the enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution as well as photocatalytic degradation and mineralization of recalcitrant pollutants under solar irradiation is an urgent requirement from the clean energy and environment point of view all over the globe. Herein, we demonstrate the decoration of Pt by photodeposition method on the hydrothermally synthesized RGO-TiO2 nanocomposite. The various photocatalysts synthesized were successfully characterized by XRD, FTIR, Raman, UV visible absorption spectra, XPS, SEM and TEM techniques. The well characterized photocatalysts were further investigated for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution studies of methanol water mixtures under UV as well as simulated solar light irradiation. The optimized Pt-RGO-TiO2 (1 wt % Pt and 10 wt % RGO) composite was found to show 14 fold increase in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution efficiency under UV light irradiation and 20 fold increase under simulated solar light irradiation as compared to bare TiO2 under UV light irradiation. The ternary photocatalyst showed very good recycle and reuse capability up to 4 cycles. The optimized Pt-RGO-TiO2 was further tested for the enhanced photocatalytic degradation and mineralization of pharmaceutical pollutant namely beta blocker Propranolol under UV as well as simulated solar light irradiation. The obtained results showed 79% and 94% reduction in COD of Propranolol under UV and simulated solar light irradiation respectively. The appreciable enhancement in the photocatalytic activity of the Pt decorated RGO-TiO2 photocatalyst as compared to bare TiO2 under UV and simulated solar light can be attributed to the use of maximum range of solar spectrum along with their excellent properties of charge separation by RGO and Pt.

AB  - Addressed herein, the synthesis of the monodisperse poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)(PEDOT) supported palladiumnickel nanomaterials (3.32 +/- 0.36 nm) and their applications as a catalyst in dimethylamine-borane (DMAB) dehydrogenation is outlined. Microwave assistance procedure was used in preparation of nanomaterials where palladium and cobalt cations were reduced in PEDOT solution (Pd-Ni@PEDOT) in microwave conditions. The characterization of the nanocatalyst was performed by using UV-VIS, XRD, XPS, TEM and HR-TEM-EELS analyses. The Pd-Ni@PEDOT NPs were found to be highly effective and stable for the dehydrogenation of DMAB. The catalytic activity of Pd-Ni@PEDOT was one of the highest one among the all prepared catalysts in literature even at lower temperatures and concentrations, yielding to give high turnover frequency (451.2 h(-1)) and low E-a (50.78 +/- 2 kJ/mol) for dehydrocoupling of DMAB.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mass pure Ti/graphene (GE) composites have been synthesized by direct ball-milling Ti powders and GE nanosheets. Through adjusting the reaction conditions, Ti-C bonding in Ti/GE composites was constructed on the interface between Ti nanoparticles and GE nanosheets, which was also confirmed by the following Raman and XPS measurements. Pressure-composition-isotherm (PCT) curves showed that the Ti/GE composites exhibited a higher hydrogen storage capacity (4.3 wt% for H-2 at 300 degrees C, 0.08 bar) and lower equilibrium pressure compared with that of simply physically mixed sample. In addition, the hydrogen adsorption process and the mechanism for the Ti/GE composites have also been investigated, in which a Kubas-enhanced adsorption process was found in the composites. In this Kubas-type adsorption process, hydrogen was adsorbed firstly by Ti atoms with a formation of Ti-H bonding and then the bonded hydrogen was spilled over to graphene, forming a C-H interaction.

TI  - Phosphatizing engineering of heterostructured Rh2P/Rh nanoparticles on doped graphene for efficient hydrogen evolution in alkaline and acidic media
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A wide diversity of phosphides of platinum-group metal including Rh, Ru and Ir exhibit intriguing electrocatalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The phosphidation degree, namely the P dosage in these phosphides shows pronounced influence on the catalytic performance but is hard to control. In this work we developed a reliable strategy to synthesize Rh2P-based nanoparticles with controlled phosphidation degree, and investigated the influence of phosphidation degree on HER. It is found that the heterostructured Rh2P/Rh nanoparticle, i.e., the P-deficient composite with mixed metallic and phosphide phases, outperforms either the metallic Rh or pure Rh2P nanoparticles. As-synthesized Rh2P/Rh nanoparticles supported on P/N co-doped graphene (denoted as Rh2P/Rh-G) display remarkable HER activity with tiny overpotential of 17 and 19 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) current density in alkaline and acid, efficiently surpassing its Rh-based rivals and benchmark Pt/C catalyst. Meanwhile it illustrates a large mass-specific activity (3.23 and 6.26 A mg(-1)@50 mV overpotential in alkaline and acid, respectively) due to its high activity and low metal loading. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation indicates that the Rh2P/Rh heterostructured interface possesses the optimal close-to-zero value of hydrogen adsorption energy and water dissociation process is accelerated, and thus boosts HER activity.

TI  - Amide-ISinduced monodispersed Pt(100) nanoparticles loaded on graphene surface for enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Using free and sustainable solar energy to produce hydrogen is the most promising strategy to resolve the environmental pollution and global energy crisis. The properties of sensitized matrix and co-catalyst, including the dispersibility, lattice structure and electrical performance, are usually two the decisive factors for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. This paper reports a facile synthetic process of surface-clean monodisperse Pt(100) nanocubes supported on graphene surface using amide functional groups as induction sites. The prepared catalyst (AG/Pt(100)) not only incorporate plentiful amide functional groups that act as the dispersant and stabilizer into surface and edge of graphene, but also significantly dislodge the oxygen-containing functional groups, which hold strong promise for improving conductivity, carrier concentration and mobility of sensitized matrix. Simultaneously, the monodisperse Pt(100) nanocubes supported on graphene surface exposure more active sites. These results provide the necessary conditions for efficient catalysts. Without any pre-treatment, it exhibits high H-2 generation activity (553.7 mu mol for 2 h) and apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) (33.9% at 430 nm) under visible light irradiation when Eosin Y is used as photosensitizer. These superior production H-2 activities can attribute to enhance the dispersion and conductivity of sensitized matrix, construct special geometry of Pt(100) nanocubes and prolong the lifetime of photogenerated electron.

TI  - Ni-Ni3P nanoparticles embedded into N, P-doped carbon on 3D graphene frameworks via in situ phosphatization of saccharomycetes with multifunctional electrodes for electrocatalytic hydrogen production and anodic degradation
T2  - APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of new, clean and efficient catalytic materials for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has become extremely unstoppable. Herein, the heterostructural Ni-Ni3P nanoparticles embedded into N\P co-doped carbon shells on 3D graphene frameworks (Ni-Ni3P@NPC/rGO) was synthesized viaan in situ phosphatization of nickel well-integrated with the structure engineering of carbon matrix derived from saccharomycetes. The in-situ phosphating process of nickel using P source provided by saccharomycetes is particularly simple, economical and environmentally friendly. In addition, the as-prepared Ni-Ni3P@NPC/rGO exhibits superior bifunctional electrocatalytic performance toward both HER (extremely low overpotential of 113 mV at 20 mA cm(-2)) and urea degradation reaction (UDR, only 1.38 V to attain 50 mA cm(-2)). Furthermore, a two-electrode electrolyzer employing the 3D block electrode (Ni-Ni3P@NPC/rGO/GFB) couple on both cathode and anode, can produce higher current density with lower voltage in urea-based wastewater splitting less than pure water splitting (saved 448 mV to deliver 500 mA g(-1)).

TI  - W-Doped MoO2/MoC Hybrids Encapsulated by P-Doped Carbon Shells for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution
T2  - ENERGY TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (USP), as an industrially-scalable synthetic technique used to prepare mesoporous products, has rarely been developed for accessing porous metal carbide hybrids for electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we report a mesoporous hybrid consisting of tungsten (W)-doped molybdenum oxide/molybdenum carbide (MoO2/MoC) nanoparticles encapsulated by phosphorus (P)-doped carbon shells (W-MoO2/MoC@PC) as an efficient electrocatalyst using this technique. The utilization of SiO2 as a hard template endows W-MoO2/MoC@PC with a mesoporous structure, and the effective W-doping further enhances the HER electrocatalytic performance of W-MoO2/MoC@PC catalyst. As expected, W-MoO2/MoC@PC shows a low overpotential (eta(20) = 208 mV in 0.5 m H2SO4 and 209 mV in 1.0 m KOH for reaching a current density of 20 mA cm(-2)), and good stability in both acidic and basic electrolyte, which is a promising noble-metal-free HER catalyst. Moreover, this facile synthesis strategy is also suitable for preparing other metal-doped Mo-based nanocomposites, which can be used in the fields of electrocatalytic water splitting and energy conversion.

TI  - Three-dimensional graphene promoted by palladium nanoparticles, an efficient electrocatalyst for energy production and storage
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Three-dimensional (3D) graphene was easily obtained by a simple hydrothermal method from two-dimensional (2D) graphene to create the interspace sites and active surface area. So, the fabrication of the 3D-graphene nanocomposite is promising for advanced energy production and storage application. The structure of the 3D-graphene nanocomposite was characterized by various techniques. Then, 3D-graphene was decorated with Pd nanoparticles. Morphological characterization shows the porous structure of 3D-Pd/rGO, so it has a high electroactive surface area. The function of the electrocatalyst toward the supercapacitor, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) were investigated. The obtained results as a supercapacitor displayed that the supercapacitor on 3D-Pd/rGO has a high specific capacitance of 582.0 F g(-1), the high energy density of 180 (W h Kg(-1)), high power density of 3750 (W Kg(-1)), long potential window of 1.00 V and long life. The electrocatalyst shows the small onset potential of -0.08 V (us. RHE), Tafel slope of 29 mV dec(-1) and high durability. Also, in the electro analytical application of the nanocompound as an electrocatalyst for ORR shows an excellent onset potential of 0.90 V (us. RHE), slow drop in the current density (34% in the presence of MeOH) and the reduction process via a four electrons pathway. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Ternary PtRuFe nanoparticles supported N-doped graphene as an efficient bifunctional catalyst for methanol oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we have synthesized N-doped graphene (NG) supported ternary PtRuFe nanocatalyst with size ranging from 2 to 3 nm using microwave-assisted polyol method and evaluated its electrochemical activity towards methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) and proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), respectively. The as-prepared bifunctional PtRuFe/NG catalyst exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity towards both MOR and ORR. During MOR, the PtRuFe/NG catalyst showed the stronger CO tolerance, lower onset potential, and higher methanol oxidation current than that of its un-doped counterpart (PtRuFe/rG0). In ORR, the catalyst exhibited higher oxygen reduction current with four electron transfer. The maximum power density delivered by PEMFC and DMFC using PtRuFe/NG were 870 and 112 mW cm(-2), respectively, which are 25% higher than that of its un-doped counterpart. Also PtRuFe/NG showed 2- to 3-fold improvement in MOR, ORR, PEMFC and DMFC performances as compared with previously reported values of mono-, bi-, and tri-metallic catalysts supported on NG and other carbon substrates. The enhanced electrochemical activity may be attributed to the synergetic effect of nitrogen-doping along with the bifunctional and ligand effects of alloying low-cost Fe with Pt and Ru. The bifunctional ternary PtRuFe nanocatalysts supported on N-doped graphene has excellent potential to catalyze both MOR and ORR with remarkable reduction in the processing cost of fuel cells which is the primary problem facing the commercialization of fuel cells.

TI  - Controlled synthesis of CdS nanoparticles and their surface loading with MoS2 for hydrogen evolution under visible light
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Spherical CdS nanoparticles with uniform diameter of 150 nm and good dispersity are prepared through the hydrothermal process with cadmium acetate and thiourea as precursors and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide as structure promoter. Shape and size of the CdS particles are strongly dependent on the stirring time in the pretreatment of the reactants before the hydrothermal process, and the growth mechanism is proposed. MoS2-CdS composites are successfully synthesized by loading MoS2 on the as-prepared CdS via the second hydrothermal process. The formation of MoS2 on CdS is investigated through varying the reaction time in the second hydrothermal step. The MoS2-CdS photocatalyst shows an optimal H-2 evolution rate of 5.24 mmol h(-1) g(-1) for water splitting under visible light in the presence of lactic acid as sacrificial agent. This study provides a simple way to prepare uniform CdS nanoparticles and CdS based visible-light-responded composite photocatalysts. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Synthesis, characterization and performance of a novel Ni-Co/GO-TiO2 for electrooxidation of methanol and ethanol
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to find out electrocatalysts based on non-precious metals, Ni-Co/GO-TiO2 composite with different amounts of nickel and cobalt is prepared and the impacts of TiO2 nanoparticles on GO support are highlighted. Composition, morphology and textural features of the synthesized materials are characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and field emission scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. The electrochemical activity of the prepared catalysts toward methanol and ethanol electrooxidation in alkaline media is investigated by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and chronoamperometry. Results confirmed that adding TiO2 nanoparticles to graphene oxide can increase the surface area, porosity and electrochemically active surface area of the support material. The composition with the equal amount of nickel and cobalt precursors exhibited the highest current density for methanol and ethanol electrooxiation equal to 121.07 and 145.28 mA/cm(2), respectively. Stability test results demonstrated that this sample maintains 94.1% and 87.5% of initial current density after 7200 s for the electrooxidation of ethanol and methanol in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. All results confirm the synergic effect of Ni and Co for the alcohols oxidation in alkaline media and equal amount of Ni and Co leads to the best catalytic performance with the highest current density, lowest impedance and maximum stability.

TI  - Heterogeneous cobalt phosphides nanoparticles anchored on carbon cloth realizing the efficient hydrogen generation reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Intrinsic activity modifying of electrocatalysts is crucial to realizing the excellent catalytic performance towards hydrogen evolution reaction. Herein, we demonstrate a highly efficient electrocatalyst based on heterogeneous cobalt phosphides nanoparticles. The ultra fine size of the as-prepared catalyst (similar to 5 nm) ensures the efficient extension of active sites. Furthermore, the incorporation of orthorhombic CoP and Co2P contributes to the improvement of the inherent catalytic property. As a consequence, the as-prepared heterogeneous cobalt phosphides nanoparticles supported on carbon cloth exhibit impressive electrocatalytic activity, which only acquire a small overpotential of 90 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and present a low Tafel slope (67.9 mV dec(-1)), a large exchange current density (0.58 mA cm(-2)) as well as good durability. Therefore, this work provides a favorable guidance for exploring executable strategies to improve catalyst activity. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Rh nanoparticles supported on graphene as efficient catalyst for hydrolytic dehydrogenation of amine boranes for chemical hydrogen storage
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Well dispersed 2.4 nm Rh nanoparticles (NPs) supported on graphene have been synthesized via a one-step in situ procedure by using methylamine borane (MeAB) as the reducing agent. Compared with other conventional supports, such as carbon black, SiO2, gamma-Al2O3, and the physical mixture of Rh and graphene, the as-prepared Rh NPs supported on graphene exhibit superior catalytic activity towards the hydrolysis of ammonia borane. Kinetic studies of catalytic hydrolysis of amine boranes indicate that the as-synthesized Rh/graphene is first order with respect to Rh concentration. Among all the reported Rh-based catalysts, the Rh/graphene exhibits the highest turnover frequency (TOP) values of 325 and 146 min(-1), the lowest activation energy (Ea) values of 19.7 and 16.4 kJ/mol, toward hydrolysis of ammonia borane (AB) and MeAB, respectively.

TI  - Immobilized phosphotungstic acid for the construction of proton exchange nanocomposite membranes with excellent stability and fuel cell performance
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Phosphotungstic acid (HPW) has a good potential as nanofillers in nanocomposite proton exchange membrane with the prerequisite of solving the leakage issue. It is immobilized onto mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (mg-C3N4) nanosheets surface, and then incorporated into sulfonated poly (aryl ether sulfone) (SPAES) membrane. Structures of the HPW/mg-C3N4 nanocomposites and corresponding SPAES/HPW/mg-C3N4 membranes are characterized by spectroscopic techniques. Fundamental properties and fuel cell performance of the fabricated nanocomposite membranes, and the leakage of HPW are investigated. Along with the highly suppressed HPW leakage, the SPAES/HPW/mg-C3N4 membranes show improved dimensional stability, water affinity and physicochemical stability, as well as better proton conductivity and fuel cell performance. At 80 degrees C and 60 -100% RH, the SPAES/HPW/mg-C3N4-1.5 membrane exhibits 2-3.6 times peak power densities (354.9-584.2 mW/cm(2)) of the pristine SPAES membrane, and proton conductivity of 203 mS/cm, dimensional change less than 7.5% and weight loss of 1.4% in Fenton oxidation test at 80 degrees C.

TI  - Three-dimensional porous graphene supported Ni nanoparticles with enhanced catalytic performance for Methanol electrooxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Three-dimensional porous graphene (3D-G) is prepared by template-assembly method and employed as catalyst support for Ni nanoparticles for methanol electrooxidation. Morphology characterization confirm that Ni nanoparticles with sizes around 20 nm are uniformly scattered on the pore wall surface of the three-dimensional graphene without apparent agglomeration. Electrochemical measurements indicate that the Ni/3D-G processes higher electrocatalytic activity for methanol oxidation reaction than that of the Ni nanoparticles supported on two-dimensional graphene (Ni/2D-G) and Ni nanoparticles without graphene. The peak current density on Ni/3D-G is 64.6 mA cm(-2), which is 1.5 times higher than that on Ni/2D-G. The remarkable electrocatalytic performance of the Ni/3D-G catalyst are mainly derived from the 3D graphene. As a carrier for methanol oxidation, the 3D-G with abundant pore architecture not only hinder the agglomeration of Ni particles that is beneficial to accelerating the efficient charge transport through the whole catalyst, but also offer readily accessible channels for the diffusion of CH3OH to the active sites of catalyst surface.

TI  - Strategic synthesis of graphene supported trimetallic Ag-based core-shell nanoparticles toward hydrolytic dehydrogenation of amine boranes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We reported the synthesis and characterization of two trimetallic (Ag@CoFe, and Ag NiFe) core-shell nanoparticles (NPs), and their catalytic activity toward hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane (AB) and methylamine borane (MeAB). The as-synthesized trimetallic core-shell NPs were obtained via a facile one-step in situ procedure using methylamine borane as a reducing agent and graphene as the support under ambient condition. The as-synthesized NPs are well dispersed on graphene, and exhibit higher catalytic activity than the catalysts with other conventional supports, such as the SiO2, carbon black, and gamma-Al2O3. Additionally, compared with NaBH4 and AB, the as-synthesized ApCoFe/graphene NPs reduced by MeAB exhibit the highest catalytic activity, with the turnover frequency (TOP) value of 82.9 (mol H-2 min(-1) (mol Ag)(-1)), and the activation energy (E-a) value of 32.79 kJ/mol. Furthermore, the as-prepared NPs exert good durable and magnetically recyclability for the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of AB and MeAB. Moreover, this simple strategic synthesis method can be easily extended to the facile preparation of other graphene supported multi-metal core shell NPs.

AB  - Photocatalytic technology for hydrogen evolution from water splitting and pollutant degradation is one of the most sustainable methods. Here, the graphene/g-C3N4-Co composite materials have been prepared by one-pot calcination method. The results show that g-C3N4 grow on the surface of graphene and form a sandwich structure, meanwhile, the introduction of Co increases the active sites, which promotes the photocatalytic performance. The influences of graphene and Co content on photocatalytic activity were also studied by UV-visible spectrophotometry (DRS), photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL), photocurrent, degradation MB, and hydrogen production. The apparent reaction rate constant k of graphene/g-C3N4-Co (3%) is 0.946 h(-1), which is 4.90 and 2.18 times faster than g-C3N4 and graphene/g-C3N4, respectively. And the hydrogen production rate of graphene/g-C3N4-Co (3%) (892.3 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) is 3.53 and 1.61 times higher than g-C3N4 and graphene/g-C3N4, respectively.

AB  - PbPt core-shell-like nanoparticles supported on graphene is successfully synthesized by a simply galvanic displacement reaction method. The composition, morphology, structure of the catalyst and activity towards methanol oxidation are characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and cyclic voltammetry (CV). Chronoamperometric and CV results reveal that PbPt core-shell-like nanoparticles catalyst has better activity towards methanol oxidation than the pure platinum prepared under the same conditions. These behaviors are attributed to an electronic effect of the inner Pb or the increase in the d-orbital vacancy of Pt in core-shell-like PbPt catalyst.

TI  - Efficient and stable HER electrocatalyst using Pt-nanoparticles@poly(3,4 ethylene dioxythiophene) modified sulfonated graphene nanocomposite
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The green production of hydrogen by electrochemical water splitting has been recently paid attention. It is more focused to research about the preparation of efficient electrocatalysts, which catalyze hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic media at low over potential. Platinum is known as an ideal option, but its rarity and high-cost limit its application in practical industrial plants. Hence, minimizing the level of it can be a solution. It can be achieved by the decoration of platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) on the different composites such as poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene, PEDOT) and sulfonated graphene nanosheets (SG) in this work. Accordingly, the successful preparation and HER electrocatalytic manner of this nanocomposite were main objectives in the present report. The related characterization and performance were monitored using various analytical and electrochemical techniques. The low charge transfer resistance (around 50 0), low over potential (-0.040 V vs. RHE), and stable manner (until 500 cycles) resulted in this HER electrocatalyst. It was controlled by Tafel reaction with electrochemical adsorption desorption because of kinetic factors including Tafel slope (28.4 mV dec(-1)), charge transfer coefficient of 2.0, and exchange current of 7.27 mA cm(-2).

TI  - Ion assisted anchoring Sn nanoparticles on nitrogen-doped graphene as an anode for lithium ion batteries
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Though lithium ion batteries are popular in many fields, high performance electrode materials with reasonable structure are desired. Herein, Sn/nitrogen-doped graphene (NGN) was fabricated with the help of 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane anion (TCNQ center dot(-)). TCNQ center dot(-) was used to anchor Sn4+ into the graphene layer with the electrostatic interaction, which improves the distribution of Sn nanoparticles. Meanwhile, TCNQ center dot(-) acts as a nitrogen source to construct N doped graphene, enhancing the electron conductivity of the composite. Benefiting from the strong structure and good ion/electron conductivity, the Sn/ NGN composite achieved excellent electrochemical battery performance. At high rates of 1 and 2 A g(-1), capacities of 433 and 353 mA h g(-1) were acquired, respectively. Moreover, the Sn/NGN composite outputted a high capacity of 584 mA h g(-1) at the end of 1000 cycles at 1 A g(-1). (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Enhanced photocatalytic activities of three-dimensional graphene-based aerogel embedding TiO2 nanoparticles and loading MoS2 nanosheets as Co-catalyst
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel graphene-based three-dimensional (3D) aerogel embedded with two types of functional nanomaterials had been prepared by a facile one-pot hydrothermal process. During the hydrothermal reaction, graphene, TiO2 nanoparticles and MoS2 nanosheets were self-assembled into the 3D interconnected networks aerogel, where the uniformly dispersed TiO2 nanoparticles were densely anchored onto the graphene nanosheets and decorated with the ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets. The UV-vis DRS and PL spectra measurement shows that the MoS2/P25/graphene aerogel exhibits enhanced light absorption and efficient charge separation properties. As a new photocatalyst, the photocatalytic activity was evaluated by photoelectrochemical test and photodegradation methyl orange (MO) under UV irradiation, an improvement of photocurrent was observed, as 6 times higher for MoS2/P25/graphene aerogel (37.45 mA/cm(2)) than pure P25 at +0.6 V, and the fastest photodegradation of MoS2/P25/graphene aerogel was found within 15 min. The improved photocatalytic activity is attributed to the porous structure, good electrical conductivity and the maximization of accessible sites of the unique 3D graphene aerogel, the increasing active adsorption sites and photocatalytic reaction centers for the introduction of MoS2 nanosheets, and the positive synergetic effect between the three components in this hybrid. This work demonstrates that the as-prepared MoS2/P25/graphene aerogel may have a great potential application in photoelectrochemical hydrogen production and pollution removal.

TI  - Platinum and platinum-iron alloy nanoparticles dispersed nitrogen-doped graphene as high performance room temperature hydrogen sensor
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present work, room temperature hydrogen sensing properties of platinum (Pt) and platinum iron (Pt3Fe) alloy nanoparticle (NP) decorated nitrogen doped graphene were investigated. In order to incorporate the nitrogen functional groups within the graphene matrix, first graphene was coated with the nitrogen anionic polyelectrolyte followed by the pyrolysis in inert atmosphere. Further Pt and Pt3Fe nanoparticles were decorated on nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) by modified polyol reduction technique. The systemic investigation of hydrogen sensing properties of Pt/NG and Pt3Fe/NG NPs at 4 vol% of hydrogen reveals the excellent sensitivity of these composites. The present study shows that Pt3Fe/NG NPs composite can be believed as a high performance room temperature sensing material. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

AB  - MnFe2O4/Graphene and ZnFe2O4/Graphene Nanocomposites (MFG & ZFG) were synthesized by sol-vothermal route and further tested as promising electrocatalyst towards Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER). The morphology, structural and electrochemical activity of the nanocomposites were studied by X-ray Diffraction, Scanning electron microscopy, Transmission electron microscopy, Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV), Cyclic Voltammetry, Tafel polarization and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). MnFe2O4/Graphene and ZnFe2O4/Graphene nanocomposites were found efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen generation via the hydrogen reduction mechanism. The nanocomposites exhibited good activity in acidic medium with a low over potential (313 mV and 315 mV) and a Tafel slope of 106.4 mVdecade(-1) and 114.3 mVdecade(-1) respectively. An exchange current density of 60.11 mAcm(-2) , 47 mAcm(-2), TOF being 1.47H(2)/s and 1.09H(2)/s was observed for MFG and ZFG. Further, an electrochemical specific surface area of 1.51 mFcm(-2), 0.3 mFcm(-2) and a less charge transfer resistance value of 8.5 Omega and 13.0 Omega was calculated for MFG and ZFG electrocatalysts respectively. The kinetic parameters indicated that the reaction was governed by Volmer mechanism. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - One-step synthesis of graphene supported Ru nanoparticles as efficient catalysts for hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ru nanoparticles supported on graphene have been synthesized via a one-step procedure using methylamine borane as reducing agent. Compared with NaBH4 and ammonia borane, the as-prepared Ru/graphene NPs reduced by methylamine borane exhibit superior catalytic activity towards the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane. Additionally, the Ru/graphene NPs exhibit higher catalytic activity than its graphene free counterparts, and retain 72% of their initial catalytic activity after 4 reaction cycles. A kinetic study shows that the catalytic hydrolysis of ammonia borane is first order with respect to Ru concentration, the turnover frequency is 100 mol H-2 min(-1) (mol Ru)(-1). The activation energy for the hydrolysis of ammonia borane in the presence of Ru/graphene NPs has been measured to be 11.7 kJ/mol, which is the lowest value ever reported for the catalytic hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane.

TI  - In situ synthesis of gold nanoparticles on N-doped graphene quantum dots for highly efficient catalytic degradation of nitrophenol
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In our work, a simple and green method of in situ synthesis of Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) on graphene quantum dots doped with nitrogen (NGQDs) was reported. Construction of the nanocomposite was accomplished through mixing the NGQDs and HAuC1(4)center dot 4H(2)O with no additional reductant and surfactant. The as-obtained Au NPs-NGQDs nanocomposite exhibited high catalytic activity in its application in the degradation of p-nitrophenol (4-NP), a pertinacious pollutant occuring in industrial wastewater. Characterization results indicated that Au NPs were well distributed upon the surface of NGQDs and Au NPs-NGQDs nanocomposites were formed. Such Au NPs can provide high catalytic activity due to its naked catalytic surface with no surfactant capping. Turnover frequency (TOF) was used to examine the catalytic efficiency and its value was obtained to be 12 h(-1). Furthermore, the as-obtained catalyst exhibited high reusability in the catalytic process of the degradation of 4-NP. This study indicates that such novel nanocomposite is promising for catalytic degradation of 4-NP. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Phosphorus-doping and addition of V2O5 into Pt/graphene resulting in highly-enhanced electrophoto synergistic catalysis for oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Both the introduction of photo-responsive metal oxide and the heteroatoms-doping into Pt-based catalysts may be a promising strategy to enhance its catalytic properties. In this paper, one-pot solid phase synthesis was employed to synthesize Pt (P)-V2O5/CNs catalyst, and it is shown that the addition of photo-responsive V2O5 and the doping of P are successfully achieved. Electrochemical measurements show that the Pt (P)-V2O5/CNs exhibits attractive bi-functional electrocatalytic property for ORR and HER, in comparison with the commercial PtRu/C-JM catalyst. More importantly, Pt (P)-V2O5/CNs presents much better electro-photo synergistic catalysis both for ORR and HER due to its excellent photoresponsive properties of V species in Pt (P)-V2O5/CNs, resulting in drastically enhanced catalytic activity and stability under the simulated sunlight irradiation.

TI  - Effective improvement of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution via a facile in-situ solvothermal N-doping strategy in N-TiO2/N-graphene nanocomposite
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nanocomposite NTNG composed of nitrogen-doped titanium dioxide (N-TiO2) and nitrogen-doped graphene (N-graphene) is synthesized to increase the photocatalytic efficiency for hydrogen production through a convenient in-situ solvothermal nitrogen-doping strategy. TEM and AFM images suggested that NTNG nanosheet consists of approximately 1-5 layers by folding its own sheet and that the wrinkled multilayer textures are stretched to a large extent due to the uniformly anchored N-TiO2 nanoparticles on N-graphene surface effectively avoiding the aggregation. XPS results indicated that the in-situ solvothermal nitrogen-doping not only allows the nitrogen-doping of TiO2 but also further changes the nitrogen-doping state of N-graphene including the nitrogen content and the ratio of dopant types. Raman spectroscopy told us that N-graphene in NTNG is more ordered than separate N-graphene due to fewer defects from the improved sp(2)-hybridized nitrogen. As a result, the photocatalytic efficiency of NTNG under ultraviolet irradiation is improved about 13.1 times compared to commercial P25. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

TI  - A novel 3D hybrid carbon-based conductive network constructed by bimetallic MOF-derived CNTs embedded nitrogen-doped carbon framework for oxygen reduction reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The rational design of novel non-precious oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts with good catalytic activity for energy conversion devices is under the spotlight of current research. Herein, we designed and fabricated a novel 3D Co-derived CNTs embedded nitrogen-doped carbon framework (denoted as Co-CNTs@NCFT, where T represents the pyrolysis temperature) as an efficient ORR catalyst by pyrolysis of the bimetallic metal organic framework (MOF) in the presence of graphene oxide (GO). The optimized catalyst furnishes large specific surface area, outstanding electrical conductivity and rapid mass transport rates during reactions. Because of these synergistic advantages, the Co-CNTs@NCF900 exhibits excellent ORR catalytic activity in terms of a high onset potential of 0.96 V and a half-wave potential of 0.84 V in alkaline electrolyte, outperforming the commercial Pt/C. Furthermore, the Co-CNTs@NCF900 manifests good stability and methanol tolerance comparable to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. The presented strategy open up a new avenue for the synthesis of novel electrocatalysts derived from MOF materials for energy-related applications. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB  - The effect of intercalation of fullerene derivative Phenyl-C60-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) into polyaniline (PANI) matrix with different ratio is reported. The PANI/PCBMx (where x = 0, 2.5, 5 and 10) nanocomposites are characterized by UV-VIS spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD). The results confirm that the PANI/PCBM nanocomposites are synthesized successfully. The prepared nanocomposites are cast onto Nickel foam as a current collector and tested as a supercapacitor electrode in 2 M KOH electrolyte using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD). The effect of different current collector substrates including stainless steel, nickel metal and graphite sheet on the supercapacitor performance is compared. The electrochemical measurements show an improvement by more than two times in the specific capacitance of PANI/PCBM5 electrode compared to pure PANI electrode. It is found that, the specific capacitance is 2201 F/g at a current density of 2 A/g with a good rate capability of about 73% at 10 A/g. The energy and power densities of PANI/PCBM5 electrode are 61.9 W h/Kg and 2250 W/Kg, respectively. Furthermore, the PANI/PCBM5 electrode shows an excellent cycling stability with 96% of the capacity retention after 1000 cycles. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Improved proton conduction of sulfonated poly (ether ether ketone) membrane by sulfonated covalent organic framework nanosheets
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A type of sulfonated covalent organic framework nanosheets (TpPa-SO3H) was synthesized via interfacial polymerization and incorporated into sulfonated poly (ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) matrix to prepare proton exchange membranes (PEMs). The densely and orderly arranged sulfonic acid groups in the rigid skeleton of the TpPa-SO3H nanosheets, together with their high-aspect-ratio and well-defined porous structure provide proton-conducting highways in the membrane. The doping of TpPa-SO3H nanosheets led to an increased ion exchange capacity up to 2.34 mmol g(-1) but a 2-folds reduced swelling ratio, remarkably mitigating the trade-off between high IEC and excessive swelling ratio. Based on the high IEC and orderly arranged proton-conducting sites, the SPEEK/TpPa-SO3H-5 membrane exhibited the maximum proton conductivity of 0.346 S cm(-1) at 80 degrees C, 1.91-folds higher than the pristine SPEEK membrane. The mechanical strength of the composite membrane was also improved by 2.05-folds-74.5 MPa. The single H-2/O-2 fuel cell using the SPEEK/TpPa-SO3H-5 membrane presented favorable performance with an open voltage of 1.01 V and a power density of 86.54 mW cm(-2).

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of hydrocarbon polymer electrolyte membranes with high proton conductivities and good stability as alternatives to perfluorosulfonic acid membranes is an ongoing research effort. A facile and effective thermal crosslinking method was carried out on the blended sulfonated poly (ether ether ketone)/poly (aryl ether sulfone) (SPEEK/SPAES) system. Two SPEEK polymers with ion exchange capacities (IECs) of 1.6 and 2.0 mmol g(-1) and one SPAES polymer (2.0 mmol g(-1)) were selected to create different blends. The effect of thermal crosslinking on the fundamental properties of the membranes, especially their physicochemical stability and electrochemical performance, were investigated in detail. The homogeneous and flexible thermally-crosslinked SPEEK/SPAES membranes displayed excellent mechanical toughness (27-46 Mpa), suitable water uptake (<60%), high dimensional stability (swelling ratio < 15%) and large proton conductivity (>120 mS cm(-1)) at 80 degrees C. The thermal crosslinking membranes also show significantly enhanced hydrolytic (<2.5%) and oxidative stability (<2%). Fuel cell with t-SPEEK/SPAES (1:2:2) membrane achieves a power density of 665 mW cm(-2) at 80 degrees C. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Synthesis of ruthenium nanoparticles deposited on graphene-like transition metal carbide as an effective catalyst for the hydrolysis of sodium borohydride
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The graphene-like transition metal carbide (Ti3C2X2(X = OH, F)) which was synthesized from etching the layered Ti3AlC2 material was applied as a carrier for depositing Ru nanoparticles (Ru/Ti3C2X2). The as-prepared nanocomposites were characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, XPS and FTIR. During the hydrolysis process, Ru nanoparticles were uniformly generated on the surface of the carrier and acted as catalysts for the hydrogen generation from hydrolysis of NaBH4 at room temperature. It was found that the catalyst Ru/Ti3C2X2 exhibited excellent catalytic activity toward the hydrolysis of sodium borohydride with a hydrogen generation rate of 59.04 L H-2/g(Ru).min and an activation energy of 22.1 kJ/mol.

TI  - One-step synthesis of AuPd alloy nanoparticles on graphene as a stable catalyst for ethanol electro-oxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Room-temperature-ionic-liquid-assisted sputtering with an alloy target is utilized to synthesize the graphene-supported AuPd alloy nanoparticles, whose Au-to-Pd ratio can be well controlled. The preparation process is one-step, free of additives and stabilizers. For direct electro-oxidation of ethanol in alkaline media, the supported AuPd alloy nano particles show much higher catalytic activity compared with a commercial Pd/C catalyst and the monometallic counterpart. The optimal Au-to-Pd ratio is 1:3, and the nanocatalyst of AuPd (1:3) possesses high stability and durability. After 500 cyclic voltammetry test cycles, the anodic peak current density for ethanol electro-oxidation still remains about 91% of the initial one. Furthermore, by quantitatively analyzing the relative reactivity retention, the alloy nanoparticle catalysts with graphene as the support show much higher anti-poisoning performance than the corresponding monometallic catalysts with active C as the support.

TI  - In-situ synthesis of well dispersed CoP nanoparticles modified CdS nanorods composite with boosted performance for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Development of photocatalysts with characters of low-cost, environment friendliness, visible light response and good performance is vital for the transformation of solar energy into hydrogen fuel. Here, we constructed CoP-CdS nanorods hybrid composites via a novel two-step in-situ growth method for the first time. The obtained CoP-CdS composites exhibited remarkably enhanced photocatalytic performance and excellent stability in comparison with bare CdS nanorods. Notably, the optimum H-2 evolution rate of 1 wt% - CoP-CdS was 9.11 times higher than that of pristine CdS. The apparent quantum efficiency of the photocatalyst was calculated to be 11.6%. The superior activity of this material could be attributed to the role of well dispersed CoP nanoparticles and the intimate interface between CoP cocatalysts and CdS nanorods, which efficiently accelerated the separation and transfer of photogenerated electrons. This work provided a new in-situ growth method for the preparation of transition metal phosphides coated photocatalysts with boosted photocatalytic activity of hydrogen evolution.

TI  - Palladium-ruthenium alloy nanoparticles dispersed on CoWO4-doped graphene for enhanced methanol electro-oxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Highly dispersed nanoparticles (NPs) of Pd and Pd-Ru alloys on the 10 wt% CoWO4-doped GNS (graphene nano sheets) support have been obtained by a microwave-assisted polyol reduction and investigated for their application as efficient electrode materials for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). Structural and electrocatalytic surface characterization of hybrid materials were carried out by XRD, TEM, XPS, cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. Pure CoWO4 and CoWO4-doped GNS follow the monoclinic crystal structure and the Pd NPs (6-7 nm) dispersed on CoWO4-doped GNS follow the facecentered cubic crystal structure. It is observed that with the increase of Pd loading from 5 to 20 mg on the support, the onset potential (E-op) for MOR shifts negatively and the MOR current density increases, the magnitude of shift in E-op and increase in the MOR peak current density being the greatest in the case of 15 mg Pd loading. Introduction of Ru from 0.6 to 2.0 mg into 15 mg Pd on the catalyst support, the apparent activity of the active catalyst, 15Pd/10 wt% CoWO4-GNS improved further, the magnitude of improvement, however, being the greatest (approximate to 50%) with 1.0 mg Ru. Thus, novel 15Pd-1.0Ru/10 wt%CoWO(4)doped GNS can be a promising electrode material for MOR in alkaline solutions. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Functionality of graphene as a result of its heterogenic growth on SiC nanoparticles on the basis of reversible hydrogen storage
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents the results from research related to graphene functionality based on the production of spatial structures provided for the reversible storage of hydrogen. The functionality process was conducted during graphene synthesis onto a liquid metallic support, on a single level, using SiC nanoparticles. Within the scope of research it was proved that heterogenic growth of the domains of polycrystalline graphene onto the SiC nanoparticles is possible. These nanoparticles are in-built into the graphene structure constituting the pillars of the spatial structure. Material produced in such a way constitutes the foundation for creating a spatial 3D structure (through the rolling operation), called GraphRoll, for the reversible storage of hydrogen in order to conduct its sorption and desorption. So, independently of the theoretical configuration, deviations or a possible exception from the 2D configuration on the silicon carbide/graphene were discussed. These differences resulted from the difference between the crystallographic structures of the analyzed forms as well as the structure determined to decrease tensions within the structure.

TI  - Synergistic effect of nitrogen-doping and graphene quantum dot coupling for high-efficiency hydrogen production based on titanate nanotubes
T2  - NANOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Highly efficient H-2 production from water splitting has been achieved by N-doped titanate nanotubes (N-TNTs) decorated with graphene quantum dots (GQDs) in this work. In order to promote charge carrier transmission at the interface, a facile and environmentally friendly in situ growth method was employed to construct a strongly coupled N-TNT/GQD composite photocatalyst. The results revealed that N atoms were effectively doped into the crystal lattice of the TNTs in the form of both interstitial N and substitutional N, and the GQDs were decorated onto both the inner and outer surfaces of the N-TNTs through the formation of Ti-O-C chemical bonds. Photoelectrochemical measurements proved that, in N-TNT/GQD composite, N-doping can extend light response to the visible-light range, and the coupling with GQDs not only enhanced visible-light absorption, but also promoted interfacial charge carrier transfer. Due to the synergistic effect between N-doping and GQD coupling, the closely integrated N-TNT/GQD composite exhibits a much superior photocatalytic H-2 production performance under UV-vis irradiation, being 2.1 times higher than that of pure TNTs.

TI  - Graphene Composites with Cobalt Sulfide: Efficient Trifunctional Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reversible Catalysis and Hydrogen Production in the Same Electrolyte
T2  - SMALL
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen and sulfur-codoped graphene composites with Co9S8 (NS/rGO-Co) are synthesized by facile thermal annealing of graphene oxides with cobalt nitrate and thiourea in an ammonium atmosphere. Significantly, in 0.1 m KOH aqueous solution the best sample exhibits an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity that is superior to that of benchmark RuO2 catalysts, an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity that is comparable to that of commercial Pt/C, and an overpotential of only -0.193 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). With this single catalyst for oxygen reversible electrocatalysis, a potential difference of only 0.700 V is observed in 0.1 m KOH solution between the half-wave potential in ORR and the potential to reach 10 mA cm(-2) in OER; in addition, an overpotential of only 450 mV is needed to reach 10 mA cm(-2) for full water splitting in the same electrolyte. The present trifunctional catalytic activities are markedly better than leading results reported in recent literature, where the remarkable trifunctional activity is attributed to the synergetic effects between N,S-codoped rGO, and Co9S8 nanoparticles. These results highlight the significance of deliberate structural engineering in the preparation of multifunctional electrocatalysts for versatile electrochemical reactions.

TI  - One-pot synthesis of ultrasmall Pt-Ag nanoparticles decorated on graphene as a high-performance catalyst toward methanol oxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A one-pot synthesis method is utilized for the fabrication of ultrasmall platinum-silver nanoparticles decorated on graphene (Pt-Ag/G) catalyst. This method has several advantages such as inexpensiveness, simplicity, low temperature, surfactant free, reductant free, being environmentally friendly and greenness. In this work, graphene and silver formate were dispersed in ultrapure water in an ultrasonic bath at 25 degrees C followed by through a galvanic displacement reaction; to prepare Pt-Ag/G, PtCl2 was added to the suspension under mild stirring condition. The morphology, crystal structure and chemical compositions of the as-fabricated Pt-Ag/G and Pt/C catalysts were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) techniques. Electrochemical techniques, including cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chro-noamperometry (CA) measurements were used to analyze the electrochemical activity of the Pt-Ag/G and Pt/C catalysts. The TEM images illustrate the uniform distribution of ultrasmall Pt-Ag nanoparticles with the average size of 2-3 nm on the graphene nanosheets. The Pt-Ag/G promoted the current density 2.46 times as much as Pt/C with a negative shift in onset oxidation potential and peak potential for oxidation reaction of methanol. Besides, the novel Pt-Ag/G catalyst shows large electrochemically active surface area, lower apparent activation energy, and higher levels of durability in comparison to the Pt/C catalyst for the oxidation of methanol. The Pt- Ag/G catalyst depicts extraordinary catalytic performance and stability to those of the Pt/C catalyst toward methanol oxidation in alkaline media. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Photocatalytic activity of Ag-TiO2-graphene ternary nanocomposites and application in hydrogen evolution by water splitting
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - TiO2-graphene (P25-GR, PG) nanocomposite was fabricated with P25 and graphite oxide through a hydrothermal method, and then Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) was assembled in P25-GR (Ag-P25-GR, APG) under microwave-assisted chemical reduction. The prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), photoluminescence spectrum (PL), UV-vis absorption spectrum (UV-vis) and Raman spectrum, respectively. The results showed that Ag NPs were well dispersed on the surface of PG with metallic state. The ternary Ag-P25-GR (APG) nanocomposites possessed the extended light absorption range and more efficient charge separation properties compared to binary P25-GR (PG). Methylene blue photodegradation experiment proved that surface plasmon resonance (SPR) phenomenon had an effect on photoreaction efficiency. The corresponding hydrogen evolution rate of APG prepared with 0.002 M AgNO3 solution was 7.6 times than pure P25 and 2.7 times than PG in the test condition. The improved photocatalytic performance can be attributed to the presence of GR and SPR effect, leading to the longer lifetime of photo-generated electron-hole pairs and faster interfacial charge transfer rate. This work indicates that the photoactivity of ternary GR-based nano-composites is superior to the binary one. We expected our work could give a new train of thought on exploration of GR-based nanocomposites. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Fe3C nanoparticles decorated Fe/N codoped graphene-like hierarchically carbon nanosheets for effective oxygen electrocatalysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hierarchically porous carbon sheets decorated with transition metal carbides nano particles and metal-nitrogen coordinative sites have been proposed as the promising non precious metal oxygen electrocatalysts. In this work, we demonstrate a facile and low-cost strategy to in situ form Fe/N codoped hierarchically porous graphene-like carbon nano sheets abundant in Fe-N-x sites and Fe3C nanoparticles (Fe-N/C) from pyrolyzing chestnut shell precursor. The as-prepared Fe-N/C samples with abundant Fe-N-x sites and Fe3C nanoparticles show superior electrocatalytic activity to oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in the alkaline medium as well as high stability and methanol tolerance due to the integration of multi-factors: the high content of Fe-N-x active sites, the coexistence of Fe3C, the unique hierarchically porous structure and high conductivity of carbon matrix. The optimal Fe-N/C-2-900 sample exhibits a more positive half-wave potential (-0.122 V vs. Ag/AgCl (3 M) reference electrode) than commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst. This study provides a facile approach to synthesize Fe3C nanoparticles decorated Fe/N co-doped hierarchically porous carbon materials for effective oxygen electrocatalyst.

TI  - Solid-state synthesis of amorphous TiB2 nanoparticles on graphene nanosheets with enhanced catalytic dehydrogenation of MgH2
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A bi-component catalyst TiB2/GNSs (GNSs is the abbreviation of graphene nanosheets) is synthesized by a solid-state method. Microstructural characterizations based on SEM (scanning electron microscopy), TEM (transmission electron microscopy) and N-2 physisorption show that the size of TiB2/GNSs catalyst is at nanoscale (20-30 nm) with a surface area of 84.69 m(2) g(-1). The TiB2/GNSs nanoparticles ball milled with MgH2 and exhibit enhanced catalytic effects on the dehydrogenation properties of MgH2 compares to TiB2 and GNSs individually. DSC (differential scanning calorimetry) measurements confirm that the peak desorption temperature of MgH2-5 wt%TiB2/GNSs composites can be lowered more than 44 degrees C than the pure as-milled MgH2. And the dehydrogenation kinetics of TiB2/GNSs-doped MgH2 is severalfold acceleration compares to the pure as-milled MgH2. It is proposed that the TiB2/GNSs nanoparticles could significantly enhance the intimate interface between TiB2/GNSs and hydride, therefore, provide more active "catalytic sites" and H "diffusion channels" to reduce the dehydrogenation temperature and improve the dehydrogenation kinetics of MgH2. The synergistic effect of nano-GNSs and TiB2 nanoparticles contributes to the highly efficient for dehydrogenation of MgH2-5wt%TiB2/GNSs composites.

TI  - Electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution on iron-cobalt nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogenated carbon nanotube
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Using low-cost nonprecious metals to replace Pt as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst is promising, but still limited by their efficiency and stability. Herein, with low-cost dicyandiamide and metal salts as precursor, FeCo alloy nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogenated carbon nanotubes (FeCo-NCNTs) were facially synthesized as efficient HER electrocatalyst. Addition of iron as second element, though not facilitating the formation of carbon nanotube, was utilized to improve the physicochemical properties of metals. Via optimizing the atomic molar ratios of Fe/Co nanoparticles, the optimal Fe0.4Co0.6-NCNTs with thin carbon shell (c.a. 5-10 layer) and equally distribution of embedded alloy nanoparticles was found with outstanding HER activity. To achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), only overpotential of 50 mV, 157 mV and 202 mV were needed in acidic (0.5 M H2SO4), alkaline (1 M KOH), and neutral solutions. Its higher electrochemically active surface areas and lower electron transfer resistance may contribute to the excellent electrocatalytic HER. Furthermore, the illustrated current density slightly changed over 20 h, suggesting excellent stability. Hence, the present method provides cost-effective, high efficiency, and stable materials in developing the sustainable energy conversion systems. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - In-situ synthesis of Fe, N, S co-doped graphene-like nanosheets around carbon nanoparticles with dual-nitrogen-source as efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Iron, nitrogen, sulfur co-doped Fe/N/C catalyst (poly-AT/Me-Fe/N/C) with the structure of graphene-like nanosheets around carbon nanoparticles were successfully synthesized for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). 2-Aminothiazole and melamine were utilized as the dualnitrogen-source. The results showed that 2-Aminothiazole, as the nitrogen and sulfur source, contributed to in-situ synthesizing graphene-like nanosheets around KJ-600 carbon nanoparticles with high specific surface area (1098 m(2)/g). Proper method to introduce melamine during the synthesis could increase the content of pyridinic-N and Fe-N-x moieties in the catalyst without changing the morphology. Due to the high surface area and high content of pyridinic-N and Fe-N-x moieties, the obtained poly-AT/Me-Fe/N/C catalyst exhibited high electrochemical activity and stability with the half-wave potential of 0.84 V (RHE) in 0.1 M NaOH solution, which is merely 17 mV lower than commercial Pt/C. The electron transfer number was 3.83, indicating a nearly 4e(-) transfer for the ORR with low HO2-. (c) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Addressed herein, a highly efficient, durable and uniformly dispersed activated carbon supported palladium iridium nanomaterials (3.42 +/- 0.34 nm) were reported for the first time as a catalyst in dimethylamine-borane dehydrogenation reaction at the room temperature. The activated carbon supported palladium-iridium nanosheet (Pd-Ir NPs) is obtained by a simple ultrasonic reduction method, and the fabricated nanocatalyst have been defined by Ultra-Violet-Visible (UV-VIS), Raman spectroscopy, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM). These newly prepared Pd-Ir nanocomposites were found to be highly efficient and stable for dehydrocoupling of dimethylamine borane. The catalytic activity of the Pd-Ir NPs was excellent by showing the one of the best catalytic activity with a very high turnover frequency (295.1 h(-1)) and low E-a value of 36.6 +/- 2 kJ/mol for DMAB dehydrocoupling. Another important fact about the prepared catalyst is the reusability of the catalyst was very high and easily reused five times without any significant decrease in their catalytic performance. In the current work, the synthesize, characterization and the catalytic performance of the Pd-Ir nanoparticles for the dehydrogenation of the DMAB reaction will be discussed in detail.

AB  - Nafion based proton exchange membrane (PEM) has long been used as conventional PEM in direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) industry. However, the high cost of Nafion membrane and other drawbacks like high methanol crossover hinder the advancement of this industry. This study aims to develop a low cost membrane using sulfonated poly ether ether ketone (SPEEK) polymer. Silica and silicotungstic acid (SiWA) were incorporated into the membrane matrix using solution casting method. The optimum loading of the additives was tuned and it is discovered that the SPEEK membrane containing 10 wt% of silica and 5 wt% of SiWA has the best performance due to its high proton conductivity and moderately low methanol permeability. The performance of the membrane can further be enhanced by adding (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) and carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) as coupling agents. Inclusion of APTES and CDI in SPEEK could not only improve the compatibility between organic SPEEK and inorganic additives, but also improve the homogeneity and dispersity of the additives. As a result, the resultant membrane with a better dimensional stability achieves high selectivity (10.60 x 10(4) S.s/cm(3)) up to 6.5 times more than pristine SPEEK membrane and 1.3 times higher than the commercial Nafion 117 membrane.

TI  - Preparation of PEDOT-modified double-layered hollow carbon spheres as Pt catalyst support for methanol oxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, Pt nanoparticles (Pt NPs) deposited hybrid carbon support is prepared by modifying double-layered hollow carbon spheres(DLHCs)with poly-(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and used as anode catalyst of methanol oxidation. The structure of nanocomposites is characterized by SEM, TEM, FT-IR, XRD and XPS, confirming the greatly enhanced synergistic effect between the PEDOT and DLHCs, and illustrating the uniform distribution of Pt NPs on the PEDOT/DLHCs composite surface with a small particle size (similar to 2.63 nm). Cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry and impedance spectroscopy applied to determine the electrocatalytic activity of catalysts, it is found that the synthesized PEDOT/DLHCs/Pt possesses excellent characteristics such as large electrochemically active surface area and high mass activity of 59.45 m(2) g(-1) and 807 mA mg(-1) in 0.5 M H2SO4 containing 1 M methanol solution, which is almost 1.24 and 2.8 times greater than those of commercial Pt/C, and the catalyst exhibits superior stability after 500 durability cycles. The enhanced electrocatalytic behavior can be ascribed to the excellent electronic conductivity of PEDOT-modified DLHCs and the strong binding of PEDOT/DLHCs to Pt NPs, suggesting that the PEDOT/DLHCs/Pt is a promising electrocatalyst for direct methanol fuel cell.

AB  - An aluminum oxide, Al2O3, template is prepared using a novel Ni imprinting method with high hexagonal pore accuracy and order. The pore diameter after the widening process is about 320 nm. TiO2 layer is deposited inside the template using atomic layer deposition (ALD) followed by the deposition of 6 nm TiN thin film over the TiO2 using a direct current (DC) sputtering unit. The prepared nanotubular TiN/TiO2/Al2O3 was fully characterized using different analytical tools such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and optical UV-Vis spectroscopy. Exploring the current-voltage relationships under different light intensities, wavelengths, and temperatures was used to investigate the electrode's application before and after Au coating for H-2 production from sewage water splitting without the use of any sacrificing agents. All thermodynamic parameters were determined, as well as quantum efficiency (QE) and incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE). The QE was 0.25% and 0.34% at 400 mW & BULL;cm(-2) for the photoelectrode before and after Au coating, respectively. Also, the activation energy was 27.22 and 18.84 kJ & BULL;mol(-1), the enthalpy was 24.26 and 15.77 J & BULL;mol(-1), and the entropy was 238.1 and 211.5 kJ(-1)& BULL;mol(-1) before and after Au coating, respectively. Because of its high stability and low cost, the prepared photoelectrode may be suitable for industrial applications.</p>

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Well-dispersed Pt nanoparticles supported on Nile blue functionalized graphene nano sheets were successfully prepared on glassy carbon (GC-GNs-NB-Pt) electrode by a facile and effective two-step electrochemical method. Further electrode was fabricated where NB was formed and attached onto the surface in its polymer form (GC-GNs-NBpoly-Pt). The Pt decorated GNs-NB nanostructures were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray diffraction (EDX) microanalysis, Raman spectroscopy and electrochemical methods. The results showed a three-dimensional nanostructure for Pt nanoparticles decorated onto the functionalized GNs-NB surface. The characterized electrodes were tested for electrochemical oxidation of methanol in H2SO4. A comparison between the synthesized electrodes; GC-GNs-Pt, GC-GNs-NB-Pt and GC-GNs-NBpoly-Pt, in terms of their electrochemical performance, revealed that the GC-GNs-NB-Pt benefits of a large and exceptional electrocatalytic activity for methanol oxidation. This improved activity could be attributed to the NB playing a crucial role in dispersing and stabilizing of Pt on GNs-NB platform. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We report a simple method for the preparation of a stabilized palladium nanoparticle-polyaniline composite by mixing aniline and PdCl42- in aqueous acidic solutions. Pd nanoparticles (Pd NP) were produced by subsequent reduction of the pre-organized material with different concentrations of NaBH4. Under optimum conditions (0.1 M NaBH4 in ethanol for 1 h at 0 degrees C), Pd NP with a size of 5-10 nm were obtained, as revealed by transmission electron microscopy. The so-formed pre-organized material was also characterized with scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. The developed catalyst exhibited a large electro-chemically active surface area (25.2 m(2) g(-1) catalyst) and remarkable mass activities for the electro-oxidation of methanol (602 A g(-1) Pd) and ethanol (433 A g(-1) Pd) in alkaline media. The excellent electrocatalytic performance of the developed polyaniline-Pd NP composite material renders it as a promising anode catalyst in alkaline fuel cells.

TI  - In situ & controlled preparation of platinum nanoparticles dopping into graphene sheets@cerium oxide nanocomposites sensitized screen printed electrode for nonenzymatic electrochemical sensing of hydrogen peroxide
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - A quick, selective and sensitive electrochemical sensor for nonenzymatic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) detecting was fabricated. It was based on the in situ & controlled preparation of platinum nanoparticles (Pt) dopping into graphene sheets@cerium oxide (GS@CeO2) nanocomposites sensitized screen printed electrode (SPE). Different sizes of Pt were dopped into GS@CeO2 nanocomposites by using a simple electroless plating method. X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD) combines with Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FTIR) were used to characterize the composition of the hybrid nanomaterials. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were employed to study the interfacial properties and morphologies of different electrodes. The electrochemical properties of electrochemical sensor were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (i-t curve) methods. After all experimental parameters were optimized, the GS@CeO2-Pt hybrid nanomaterials modified SPE (SPE I GS@CeO2-Pt) showed a good performance towards the electrocatalytic reduction of H2O2. A wide linear detection range (LDR) extends from 1.0 x 10(-3) mM to 10.0 mM (R = 0.9999) and a low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.43 x 10(-3) mM (S/N = 3) were achieved. The sensor was also simple, stable and reliable. It was applied to the determination of H2O2 in contact lens care solutions with good accuracy and recovery. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Worm-like Pt nanoparticles anchored on graphene with S, N co-doping and Fe3O4 functionalization for boosting the electrooxidation of methanol
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Making use of synergy and introducing defects can effectively regulate the electronic structure of carbon nanomaterials, which is of great importance for achieving desired electrochemical performance. Herein, we report a facile protocol for preparing S, N-doped graphene with simultaneous ferroferric oxide functionalization (Fe3O4-SNG), which is then used as support to anchor Pt nanoparticles for catalyzing the anodic reaction of direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs), the promising portable power sources that have small environmental footprint, compact system design, and higher volumetric energy density compared with existing technologies. The functionalization by Fe3O4 as well as S and N doping increases the defect level in graphene, and also affect the subsequent growth of Pt particles, leading to formation of Pt nanoparticles with worm-like morphology on the surface of Fe3O4-SNG support (Pt/Fe3O4-SNC). The electrochemical evaluations show that the worm-like Pt nanoparticles anchored on Fe3O4-SNG have larger electrochemically active surface areas and enhanced specific activities for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) due to their strong electronic interaction with the supports, which also promotes the oxidative removal of the intermediate poisoning products formed during methanol electrooxidation, thereby improving the long-term stability of the Pt catalyst.

TI  - Fe3C/C nanoparticles encapsulated in N-doped graphene aerogel: an advanced oxygen reduction reaction catalyst for fiber-shaped fuel cells
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Flexible fuel cells directly convert the chemical energy to electricity, and represent one of the most promising power generators using in bendable electronic equipments such as curved displays and wearable devices. The ambient oxygen is the most acceptable oxidant, and therefore the design of highly actived and low cost oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts is extremely important for future commercialization. Here we report a facile process to fabricate the catalyst by encapsulating the Fe3C/C nanoparticles on the nitrogen doped graphene aerogel scaffolds. Benefitting from the meso-porous structure and presence of Fe-N-C functionalities that serve as the catalytic sites, the conductivity and active-site accessibility in the composites are significantly improved. The resulting hybrid electrocatalysts show a comparable catalytic performance with 20 wt% commercial Pt/C powder, but possess a much lower capital cost and higher tolerance to fuel in the durability test. Consequently, the fiber-shaped fuel cell delivers a high-power density of 4.57 W m(-2) and current density of 22.5 A m(-2), outperforming many flexible fuel cells reported previously. Such a non-noble-metal ORR catalyst opens new avenue to trigger the electricity generation by fiber-shaped fuel cell under the folded and rolled-up conditions.

AB  - Due to the large specific surface area, extraordinary mechanical flexibility, chemical stability, and superior electrical and thermal conductivities, graphene (G)-based materials have recently opened up an exciting field in the science and technology of two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials with continuously growing academic and technological impetus. In the past several years, graphene-based materials have been well designed, synthesized, and investigated for sensing applications. In this review, we discuss the synthesis and application of graphene-based 2D nanomaterials for the fabrication of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrochemical sensors. In particular, graphene-based nanomaterials as immobilization matrix of heme proteins for the fabrication of enzymatic H2O2 electrochemical biosensors is first summarized. Then, the application of graphene-based electrocatalysts (metal-free, noble-metals and non-noble metals) in constructing non-enzymatic H2O2 electrochemical sensors is discussed in detail. We hope that this review is helpful to push forward the advancement of this academic issue (189 references). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Study on improvement of the proton conductivity and anti-fouling of proton exchange membrane by doping SGO@SiO2 in microbial fuel cell applications
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to improve the proton conductivity and anti-fouling of proton exchange membrane (PEM) in microbial fuel cells, the present study prepares a novel composite proton exchange membrane. First, silicon dioxide (SiO2) is inserted into sulfonated graphene oxide (SGO) by in situ hydrolysis using ethyl orthosilicate as precursor. Then, the obtained SGO@SiO2 is blended with homopolymer poly(-vinylidene fluoride) grafted sodium styrene sulfonate (PVDF-g-PSSA). The effects of particles on the physicochemical properties and anti-fouling properties of the composite membrane are investigated. The best performance is obtained when the addition of SGO@SiO2 is 1.0%. The ion exchange capacity reaches 1.6 meq/g and the proton conductivity is 0.078 S/cm, which is higher than Nafion-117 membrane. The anti-fouling ability of composite membrane gets stronger based on the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) result. The power density of microbial fuel cell with SGO@SiO2/PVDF-g-PSSA membrane is 185 mW/m(2) after operating one month, which is superior to SGO/PVDF-g-PSSA and PVDF-g-PSSA membrane. The improvement shows that SGO@SiO2/PVDF-g-PSSA membrane could be a feasible alternative to costly membrane and have potential for application in microbial fuel cell.

AB  - Ni2P/GNS nanocomposite was synthesized by a facile and green hydrothermal technique. Microstructural characterizations demonstrated that Ni2P nanoparticles with an average size of about 5 nm were uniformly distributed in graphene nanosheets. The Ni2P/GNS nanohybrid exhibited enhanced effects on the dehydrogenation properties of MgH2 compared to Ni2P and GNS individually. The onset desorption temperature of MgH2-Ni2P/GNS composite reduced by 98 degrees C in contrast with the pure as-milled MgH2. Moreover, the MgH2-Ni2P/GNS composite could release 6.1 wt% H-2 (only 0.2 wt% H-2 for the pure as-milled MgH2) within 20 min at 325 degrees C. In addition, the relative hydrogen desorption mechanism of MgH2-Ni2P/GNS composite has also been discussed. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Fe2O3 nanocatalysts on N-doped carbon nanomaterial for highly efficient electrochemical hydrogen evolution in alkaline
T2  - JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrogen production from electrolyzed water is by far the most effective method, and the preparation of inexpensive catalysts for efficient electrolysis of water is the focus of scientists' research. In this study, it is reported that the transition metal oxide Fe2O3 nanocatalysts on N-doped carbon nanomaterials has good electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction under alkaline media. The transition metal oxides for hydrogen evolution reaction is rarely reported, while the iron-based oxides material with good electrochemical performance for hydrogen evolution reaction are few. Among them, Fe2O3 NCs calcined at 800 degrees C receives the best electrochemical performance because it has excellent electrochemical kinetics (Tafel slope = 76.6 mV dec(-1)) and good stability (At an overpotential of 350 mV, stable hydrogen evolution can be maintained at 48 h) in 1 M KOH. In addition, Fe2O3-NCs calcined at 800 degrees C is prepared by simple and inexpensive raw materials, and it is One-step synthesis, which is suitable for mass production. These advantages of this material has great potential in electrolyzed water applications.

TI  - N-doped graphene supported W2C/WC as efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tungsten carbides (W2C and WC) materials, as promising non-precious electrocatalysts, possess highly efficient activity for HER. Herein, N-doped graphene supported tungsten carbide (N-W2C/WC) nanocomposite is synthesized by spray drying process followed with a two-step pyrolysis treatment, which exhibits a remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity and excellent stability in acidic solution and alkaline solution. N-W2C/WC displays low overpotentials of 166 mV and 125 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and small Tafel slopes of 60.97 and 62.66 mV dec(-1) in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH, respectively. After 1000 cycles, the electrocatalytic activity of N-W2C/WC is almost no change in acidic media but slightly decreases in alkaline media. This work might pro-vide a new way to explore high comprehensive performance tungsten-based electro-catalyst for HER. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Anchoring and space-confinement effects to synthesize ultrasmall Pd nanoparticles for efficient ammonia borane hydrolysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrogen production from ammonia borane (AB) hydrolysis catalyzed by efficient heterogenous catalysts is regarded as a compelling strategy to meet the increasing requirement for clean energy. Palladium (Pd) nanoparticle (NP)-based catalysts have stimulated intensive attention for AB hydrolysis, while their catalytic performances still need to be significantly improved. By exploiting sodium hydroxide and three-dimensional (3D) architecture of interconnected porous carbon nanosheets (IPCNs) as a NP carrier, a simple yet efficient strategy is developed to synthesize uniformly distributed ligand-free Pd NPs (2.17 nm in diameter) for hydrogen generation from AB hydrolysis. The particle size and spatial dispersion control of Pd NPs on the IPCNs surface supply an abundance of surface-active sites and thus remarkable improve the catalytic performance for AB hydrolysis to hydrogen evolution. Specifically, the achieved Pd/IPCNs reveals an extremely high catalytic activity with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 122.8 min(-1) toward AB hydrolysis, which is higher than that of many reported Pd-based catalysts. This simple, straightforward and efficient method is of significant importance for preparing metal NP catalysts with high catalytic activities for catalytic applications.

TI  - An effective strategy to enhance the performance of the proton exchange membranes based on sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone)s
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We report an effective and facile approach to enhance the dimensional and chemical stability of sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) type proton exchange membranes through simple polymer blending for fuel cell applications, using commercial available materials. The polymeric blends with sulfonated poly(aryl ether sulfone)s (SPAES) were simply fabricated by a three-component system, which contained SPEEK (10-50 wt%, 1.83 mmol/g), and SPAES-40 (1.72 mmol/g)/SPAES-50 (2.04 mmol/g) at 1:1 in weight. The SPAES-40 was selected for mechanical and dimensional stability reinforcing, while SPAES50 for the good polymer compatibility. The obtained SPEEK/SPAES blend membranes showed depressed water uptake, better dimensional and oxidative stability, together with higher proton conductivity beyond 70 degrees C than the pristine SPEEK membrane. The apparent improvements in membrane properties were associated with the homogeneous dispersion of SPEEK and both SPAES copolymers inside the membranes as well as the rearrangements of the polymeric chains. The SPEEK content should be properly controlled in the range of 10-40% (B10 to B40). In a H-2/O-2 fuel cell test, B30 showed a maximum power density of 700 mW/cm(2), which was 1.6 times as high as that of B40 at 80 degrees C under 100% RH. The further cross-linking treatment produced more ductile and enduring blend membranes, indicating an appreciable prospective for fuel cell applications. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Room temperature hydrogen gas sensing properties of mono dispersed platinum nanoparticles on graphene-like carbon-wrapped carbon nanotubes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We present platinum nanoparticles dispersed wrinkled graphene-like carbon-wrapped carbon nanotubes (Pt/GCNTs) as a room temperature chemiresistive hydrogen gas sensor. Pt nanoparticles are decorated over GCNTs surface using poly (sodium 4-styrene sulfonate) (PSS) functionalization, followed by ethylene glycol reduction method. The highly defective wrinkled graphene-like surface of GCNTs provides large surface area and PSS functionalization provides stable immobilization of mono dispersed Pt nanoparticles on the carbon surface. A simple and inexpensive drop cast technique is used to fabricate the thick film sensor of the material. Hydrogen resistive gas sensing properties of Pt/GCNTs are studied at different gas concentrations, temperatures and Pt wt. % loadings. Pt/GCNTs sensor shows optimal sensitivity at room temperature with stable and reproducible response towards hydrogen. The sensor with 2 wt. % of Pt showed maximum sensitivity that is three fold higher than Pt decorated carbon nanotubes (Pt/CNTs) with the same Pt wt. % loading. The present study shows potential to explore novel H2 sensors (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The unique properties of two-dimensional structure, great intrinsic carrier, well developed porosity, active surface area, outstanding electronic properties and promising mechanical and thermal stability make graphene as the current support key material in the heterogeneous catalyst system. Accordingly, graphene plays a pivotal role in most heterogeneous catalysts ranging from single to bi-functional, hybrid, oxide and nano systems. This combination also inspires and widens the heterogeneous catalyst application areas, including chemical conversion, photocatalyst, electrochemical sensor, fuel cell, energy storage and others. This review highlights the advantages and limitations of carbon materials as catalyst support materials, addresses recent progress on synthesis routes with technological advances in the characterization of graphene, and follows the properties dependent of graphene as a superior catalyst support material.

TI  - Microstructured prealloyed Titanium-Nickel powder as a novel nonenzymatic hydrogen peroxide sensor
T2  - JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - At present, commercial pure Titanium (Ti) and microstructured pre-alloyed Titanium-Nickel (TiNi) powders are employed as a sensitive electrochemical hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) sensor. Surface characterization of these materials are performed by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrochemical characterization is achieved via cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry (CA), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) on Ti and TiNi modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The electrochemical behavior of H2O2 at the pure Ti/GCE and microstructure pre-alloyed TiNi/GCE are studied by CV in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS) containing as the supporting electrolyte. In addition, CA is employed for the determination of H2O2 at the applied potential of 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The sensor has a linear response range of 0.5-17.5 mM with a sensitivity of 280 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2). Moreover, the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) are 0.5 mu M and 1.7 mu M, respectively. The electrochemical sensor exhibits fast and selective responses to H2O2 concentration. The applicability of the sensor is checked using a hair coloring as a real sample with satisfactory results.

AB  - A facile synthesis at room temperature and at solid-state directly on the support yielded small, homogeneous and well-dispersed Pt nanoparticles (NPs) on CB-carbon black, GNPgraphene nanoplatelets, and CB-GNP-50:50 hybrid support. Synthesized Pt/CB, Pt/GNP and Pt/CB:GNP NPs were used as electrocatalysts for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) reactions. HRTEM results displayed very small, homogeneous and well-dispersed NPs with 1.7, 2.0 and 4.2 nm mean-diameters for the Pt/CB-GNP, Pt/GNP and Pt/CB electrocatalysts, respectively. Electrocatalysts were also characterized by RAMAN, XRD, BET and CV techniques. ECSA values indicated better activity for graphene-based supports with 19 m(2) g(Pt)(-1) for Pt/GNP and 55 m(2) g(Pt)(-1) for Pt/CB-GNP compared to 10 m(2)g(Pt)(-1) for Pt/CB. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) studies and fuel cell tests were in parallel with these results where highest maximum power density of 377 mW cm(-2) was achieved with Pt/CB-GNP hybrid electrocatalyst. Both fuel cell and ORR studies for Pt/CB-GNP indicated better dispersion of NPs on the support and efficient fuel cell performance that is believed to be due to the prevention of restacking of GNP by CB. To the best of our knowledge, Pt/GNP and Pt/CB-GNP electrocatalysts are the first in literature to be synthesized with the organometallic mild synthesis method using Pt(dba)(3) precursor for the PEMFC applications.

TI  - Ternary transition metal alloy FeCoNi nanoparticles on graphene as new catalyst for hydrogen sorption in MgH2
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present investigation deals with the synthesis of ternary transition metal alloy nanoparticles of FeCoNi and graphene templated FeCoNi (FeCoNi@GS) by one-pot reflux method and there use as a catalyst for hydrogen sorption in MgH2. It has been found that the MgH2 catalyzed by FeCoNi@GS (MgH2: FeCoNi@GS) has the onset desorption temperature of similar to 255 degrees C which is 25 degrees C and 100 degrees C lower than MgH2 catalyzed by FeCoNi (MgH2: FeCoNi) (onset desorption temperature 280 degrees C) and the ball-milled (B.M) MgH2 (onset desorption temperature 355 degrees C) respectively. Also MgH2: FeCoNi@GS shows enhanced kinetics by absorbing 6.01 wt% within just 1.65 min at 290 degrees C under 15 atm of hydrogen pressure. This is much-improved sorption as compared to MgH2: FeCoNi and B.M MgH2 for which hydrogen absorption is 4.41 wt% and 1.45 wt% respectively, under the similar condition of temperature, pressure and time. More importantly, the formation enthalpy of MgH2: FeCoNi@GS is 58.86 kJ/mol which is 19.26 kJ/mol lower than B.M: MgH2 (78.12 kJ/mol). Excellent cyclic stability has also been found for MgH2: FeCoNi@GS even up to 24 cycles where it shows only negligible change from 6.26 wt% to 6.24 wt%. A feasible catalytic mechanism of FeCoNi@GS on MgH2 has been put forward based on X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and microstructural (electron microscopic) studies.

TI  - Electrocatalytic methanol oxidation using Ni-Co-graphene composite electrodes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Exacerbation of climate change has highlighted the need for new environmentally-friendly energy sources. Fuel cells, which are devices capable of extracting electricity directly from internal chemical reactions, represent one promising concept that allows electricity generation without burning fossil fuels. Direct methanol fuel cells are one of the most popular types, and they use methanol as the fuel for electricity production. However, the current lack of suitable electrocatalytic materials limits the application of such devices on an industrial scale. This report presents a simple, one-step method for the preparation of electrocatalytic materials for methanol oxidation. The developed composite materials contain two metals (nickel and cobalt), which both exhibit catalytic properties relevant for methanol electrooxidation, and graphene, which is a carbon nanomaterial that promotes facile charge transfer and enhanced material dispersion. The tested electrodes were prepared using an electrochemical deposition process, which allowed easy control of the process conditions, such as current density, and thus easy manipulation of the final material's properties. Following this process, stable electroactive materials were prepared, and the optimal results were obtained with the electrode prepared with a current density of 3.5 A dm-2 for 15 min: this electrode had a peak current density of 15.82 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH +1 M methanol solution.

TI  - Synthesis of PdV/C nanoparticles using phase transfer method for oxygen reduction in alkaline electrolytes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Bimetallic PdV/C nanoparticles have been synthesized by phase-transfer method for catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline electrolytes. PdV/C nano particles with different V contents are spherical with a mean diameter of 3-4 nm, and the addition of V expands the lattice parameter of Pd as shown by XRD. XPS analysis indicated the binding energy of Pd degrees 3d peak increased by ca. 1 eV. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations results shows d-band center of Pd down-shift after V-doping. Based on the electrocatalytic results, introducing V can improve the catalytic activity for ORR, methanol crossover tolerance and stability. Especially, Pd4V/C shows higher initial potential (E-onset = 1.027 V), excellent methanol crossover tolerance (98.03% retained) and long-term stability (81.30% retained), which are comparable with Pt/C-JM. This work provides a new method of synthesizing PdV/C nanoparticles, which have the potential to be used as the cathode electrocatalysts for fuel cells. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Surface fluorinated nickel-graphene nanocomposites for high-efficiency methanol electrooxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Transition metal electrocatalysts with high activity and long durability are desired for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). Here, the surface fluorinated nickel-graphene nano-composites (F-Ni-G) are synthesized via the reduction of Si-H bonds produced by silicon and ammonium fluoride in hydrothermal condition. During this process, ionic nickel-F bonds and semi-ionic C-F bonds are introduced to the catalysts as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. When F-Ni-G nanocomposites are employed as MOR catalysts, the surface fluorination is contributed to the formation of nickelic, which can increase the activity and kinetics for MOR. The onset oxidation potential of F-Ni-G-2 for methanol oxidation is 53 mV lower than that of the Ni/G catalyst without fluorine. The mass activity of F-Ni-G-2 (2493.3 A g(-1)) is 3.90 folds than that of Ni/G (638.5 A g(-1)). In addition, the density functional theory calculation indicates that the modified fluorine in graphene results in the decreased reaction energy barrier from *CO to *COOH step in MOR. The strong electronegativity of F atom makes intermediates easier to attract OH- groups and repel protons, which is conductive to decrease the reaction energy barrier for MOR. Such a facile method for the fabrication of the surface fluorinated catalytic system may be extended to the preparation of other transition metal electrocatalysts.

TI  - Pd/Cu bimetallic nanoparticles supported on graphene nanosheets: Facile synthesis and application as novel electrocatalyst for ethanol oxidation in alkaline media
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Well distributed Pd/Cu bimetallic nanoparticles supported on graphene nanosheets as novel electrocatalyst has been prepared via a facile synthetic method: started with an electroless deposition route to anchor Cu nanoseeds on graphene nanosheets, followed by a latter displacement reaction to achieve Pd/Cu overlaying nanostructure. The loading density and morphology of bimetallic nanoparticles on graphene are varied by adjusting the initial amount of Cu precursor and reducing agent proportionally. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images combining energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping results confirm the existance and distribution of Pd and Cu in the bimetallic nanoparticles, while transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reveals the nanoparticle size and overlaying nanostructure. Cyclic voltammograms tests for the hybrid electrocatalysts in 1.0 M KOH solution show a gradual increase of electrochemically active surface area (EASA) against the increment of nanoparticle loading. Meanwhile, a significantly enhanced tolerance to poisoning of electrocatalyst is observed by cyclic voltammograms curves for ethanol electrooxidation in alkaline media with high If/lb ratios compared to previous research. The large enhancement on If/lb ratios of the hybrid electrocatalysts can be ascribed to the well distributed overlaying bimetallic nanostructure supported on graphene nanosheets. The facilely prepared Pd/Cu/ graphene hybrid materials demonstrate vastly superior electrocatalytic properties compared to the commercial Pd/C catalyst, indicating a great potential in fuel cells application.

TI  - One-pot synthesis of Pd20-xAux nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen doped graphene as high-performance electrocatalyst toward methanol oxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mixed Pd-Au bimetallic nanoparticles embedded nitrogen doped graphene composites (PdAu/NG180) are explored for efficient electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol. A simple hydrothermal one-pot polyol method, involving simultaneous reduction of both Pd and Au, is utilized for the synthesis of Pd20-xAux/NG180 (x wt % = 0, 5, 10 and 15). This method is of multiple advantages such as inexpensiveness, reagent-free and environment-friendly being surfactant free. The morphology, crystal structure and chemical composition of NG180, Pd/NG180 and Pd20-xAux/NG180 catalysts are analyzed by XRD, FESEM-EDX, TEM, XPS and Raman spectroscopy methods. Electrocatalytic activities of PdAu/NG180 nanocomposites toward methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in alkaline media are investigated by cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry and CO stripping measurements. Pd20-xAux/NG180 exhibited an increase in the electroactive surface area of Pd to twice by the coexistence of Au. In cyclic voltammetry studies, Pd10Au10/NG180 catalyst exhibits highest peak current density for MOR and is 1.5 times highly efficient compared to Pd-20/NG180 with an enhanced shift in the onset potential by 140 mV to lower overpotentials. Besides, Pd10Au10/NG180 catalyst exhibited enhanced electroactive surface area and long-time durability in comparison to Pd-20/NG180 catalyst. The steady state current density for MOR observed with Pd10Au10/NG180 at the end of 4000 s (98 mA mg(Pd)(-1)) is higher than those observed with all the other catalysts at the end of mere 1000 s alone (97, 61, and 32 mA mg(Pd)(-1)). The promising high electrocatalytic activity of Pd10Au10/NG180 is well corroborated from CO stripping experiments that the specific adsorption of CO onto Pd10Au10/NG180 (0.71 C m(-2)) is merely half to that observed onto Pd-20/NG180 (1.49 C m(-2)).

TI  - Emerging two-dimensional nanomaterials for electrochemical hydrogen evolution
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
M3  - Review
AB  - Hydrogen has been verified as a clean and economical energy source, due to its high mass energy density and renewability. Electrochemical water splitting is regarded as one of the most economical and eco-friendly approaches for hydrogen evolution. Recently, emerging two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have demonstrated their potential as distinguished non-noble catalysts for hydrogen evolution. These ultrathin nanomaterials are dramatically different from their bulk counterparts. Abundant active sites are maximally exposed and the small diffusion paths of the ultrathin nanosheets can effectively facilitate charge transfer in the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Moreover, many tactics can be easily adopted in such an interesting and adjustable platform, which makes the 2D material an ideal object to explore the exciting catalytic activity and electronic transfer. Various inventive strategies regarding increasing active sites, improving intrinsic activity and enhancing electrical conductivity for enhancing catalytic performance are urgently pursued. Here, the primary criteria for evaluating catalysts in electrochemical HER is discussed, followed by a brief introduction of the superiorities of 2D nanomaterial catalysts for HER. Based on these, recent strategies for improving the catalytic activity of 2D nanomaterials are summarized. We believe this review will provide deep insights for understanding the 2D material catalysts for catalyzing HER, and aid in devising new catalysts with high catalytic activity.

TI  - Noble metal-free NiCo nanoparticles supported on montmorillonite/MoS2 heterostructure as an efficient UV-visible light-driven photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a noble-metal-free photocatalyst, based on NiCo nanoparticles supported on montmorillonite/MoS2 heterostructure (MMT/MoS2/NiCo), was successfully synthesized and applied for photocatalytic water reduction to produce H-2. Under UV-visible light irradiation, the composite showed improved photocatalytic performance for H-2 evolution compared to MMT/MoS2, MMT/MoS2/Ni, MMT/NiCo, and MoS2/NiCo. The as-synthesized MMT/0.79MoS(2)/Ni8.14Co6.4 (0.79, 8.14 and 6.4 denote the weight ratios % of MoS2, Ni and Co in the catalyst) photocatalyst exhibited a high H-2 production rate of 8.7 mmol g(-1) h(-1), 26.5 and 2.3 times higher than for MMT/0.79MoS(2) and MMT/Ni8.14Co6.4, respectively. The enhanced photocatalytic performance was attributed to the loaded MoS2 and NiCo nano particles, introducing active sites, increasing the light-absorbing capacity and accelerating the charge transfer from the Eosin Y dye owing to their appropriate Fermi level energy alignment. This work presents a cost-effective method combining the 2D sheets of MMT and MoS2, and NiCo nanoparticles to form a quaternary photocatalytic system showing highly efficient hydrogen evolution from water without using noble metals.

TI  - Synthesis of novel three-dimensional mesoporous nitrogen doped graphene supported Pt nanoparticles as superior catalyst for hydrogen generation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, three dimensional mesoporous nitrogen doped graphene (3DMNG) is fabricated by hydrothermal method and assists by tube furnace calcination. The experimentally obtained 3DMNG has a porous structure (pore size at 0-55 nm) and a large specific surface area (about 1050 m(2)/g). The electrochemical results demonstrate that the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of 3DMNG is about 24.34 m(2)/g, the initial overpotential was 70 mV, the Tafel slope was 103.91 mV/dec, and the impedance is about 2.8 Omega, which is more prominent than that of other similar carbon materials. Moreover, 3DMNG plays an important role in uniforming Pt nanoparticles (1.5 nm) using microwave synthesis method. The electrochemical results testify that the ECSA of Pt/3DMNG is about 179.70 m(2)/g, the initial overpotential is close to 0 mV, the Tafel slope is only 30.72 mV/dec, and the impedance is 2.2 Omega, which is a significant improvement compared with 3DMNG. The superior electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance of Pt/3DMNG is attributed to the synergistic coupling effect between the 3DMNG and Pt nanoparticles.

TI  - Proton conducting composite membranes from crosslinked poly(vinyl alcohol) and poly(styrene sulfonic acid)-functionalized silica nanoparticles
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Proton conducting membranes based on crosslinked poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and poly (styrene sulfonic acid)-functionalized silica particles (PSSA-Si) were reported. Two-step crosslinking process involving sulfosuccinic acid (SSA) and glutaraldehyde as cross linking agents was conducted to provide additional proton source and to enhance hydrolytic and mechanical stabilities. PSSA-Si was synthesized from vinyltrimethoxysilane via Stober method, followed by radical polymerization of sodium 4-vinylbenzenesulfonate on the silica particle. The obtained PSSA-Si was characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The effects of PSSA-Si loading (0, 2.5, 5, and 10%) and PSSA content in PSSA-Si (2, 5, 8, and 12%) on membrane properties including surface morphology, water vapor absorption, water uptake, ion exchange capacity, mechanical and oxidative stabilities, and proton conductivity were investigated and discussed. Proton conductivities of these composite membranes were found to increase with PSSA-Si loading and PSSA content. Promising proton conductivities of similar to 0.072 S/cm were obtained from PVA-8%PSSA-Si-10 and PVA-12%PSSA-Si-10 membranes, having PSSA-Si loading of 10%, and PSSA contents of 8%, and 12%, respectively. In addition, these membranes showed good hydrolytic and oxidative stabilities with high storage moduli. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework-67-Derived P-Doped Hollow Porous Co3O4 as a Photocatalyst for Hydrogen Production from Water
T2  - ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
M3  - Article
AB  - As a part of photocatalytic water splitting, the design of low-cost, high-activity catalysts plays an essential role in the development of photocatalytic water splitting. Metal oxides have the advantages of a wide range of sources, many varieties, and easy preparation. Doping engineering on their surface can construct new active sites and adjust their catalytic activity. In this work, a new strategy was developed through anion hybridization to regulate electron delocalization. Using one of the cobalt-based zeolitic imidazole skeletons (ZIF-67) as a precursor material, a two-step calcination method was used to prepare a P-doped Co3O4 mixed anion composite photocatalyst. The hydrogen production rate of P@Co3O4 is 39 times that of ZIF-67 and 6.8 times that of Co3O4. Through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the electron delocalization state of the sample surface is predicted and the reaction energy barrier is reduced to promote the process of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The special O(delta-)-Co(delta+)-P(delta-) surface bonding state promotes the bridging of isolated electronic states and provides active sites for the adsorption and activation of reaction substrates. The improved electron transport pathway and the synergy between the catalytic sites under the high electron transport rate are the main reasons for the enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity. This strategy, including changing the surface bond state and optimizing the structure and composition of the catalyst not only provides a new method for preparing other MOF-derived nanomaterials with porous structures but also inspires the reasonable development of other MOF-based advanced photocatalysts.

TI  - Scalable synthesis of self-assembled bimetallic phosphide/N-doped graphene nanoflakes as an efficient electrocatalyst for overall water splitting
T2  - NANOSCALE
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to achieve clean hydrogen energy through overall water splitting, it is vitally important but still challenging to develop highly efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts to replace the noble metal-based electrocatalysts (e.g. Pt- and Ru-based catalysts). To address this issue, herein, we present a facile and scalable spray drying and subsequent phosphorization approach to synthesize iron-cobalt bimetallic nanoflakes encapsulated in N-doped graphene (FCP@NG). The optimized FCP@NG exhibits excellent performance in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and overall water splitting. It demonstrates remarkable performance in the HER and superior activity in the OER, even outperforming the state-of-the-art RuO2 catalyst. Being employed as both the cathode and anode on nickel foams, this FCP@NG hybrid demonstrates promising performance in overall water splitting with a very low potential of 1.63 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior among most of the recently reported transition-metal-based catalysts and comparable to the commercial Pt/RuO2 cell. The outstanding electrocatalytic performance of FCP@NG is attributed to a synergistic effect of its bi-metallization, unique nanoflake structure and conductive N-doped graphene encapsulation. This work provides a scalable and low-cost strategy to synthesize nonprecious and bi-functional transition-metal-based catalysts with unique nanoarchitecture and outstanding catalytic performance for overall water splitting.

TI  - Palladium nanoparticles grown on beta-Mo2C nanotubes as dual functional electrocatalysts for both oxygen reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing efficient dual functional electrocatalysts for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is critical for boosting the performance of fuel cells and metal air batteries, as well as production of clean and sustainable energy source. Herein, Pd nanoparticles grown on Mo2C nanotubes were prepared as dual functional electrocatalysts for both ORR and HER. A series of samples with different Pd loadings were fabricated, while the morphology and the structural features were well examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Interestingly, both the ORR activity and HER activity first increased then decreased with the increasing of Pd loading, and the sample of Mo2C-Pd-9% exhibited the best performance among the series, superior than commercial Pd/C in both ORR and HER tests. Furthermore it also exhibited markedly higher long-term stability than Pd/C for both electrocatalytic reactions. The results may shed light on rational design of novel bifunctional electrocatalysts in the renewable energy field. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The subject of this paper is a new idea of how to get around problems of irreversibility and low capacity of the graphene hydrogen storage. The clue is using a composite of nano electromechanical systems (NEMS) graphene and hydrogen for hydrogen storage. Basic scheme of attosecond nanotechnology of the reversible hydrogenation-dehydrogenation of the NEMS graphene hydrogen storage is proposed. The relaxation of the NEMS composite consisting of small graphene nanosheets and hydrogen biradicals is described by the quantum NEMS-kinetics method. As a result of computer simulation the dependence physicochemical characteristics of the NEMS composite on concentration of hydrogen, size of graphene nanosheets, temperature and time of relaxation is revealed. The theoretical substantiation that the NEMS composite stands as promising candidate to easily reversible and highly capacious hydrogen storage is given.

TI  - Enhanced hydrogen-storage properties of MgH2 by Fe-Ni catalyst modified three-dimensional graphene
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - High dehydrogenation temperature and slow dehydrogenation kinetics impede the practical application of magnesium hydride (MgH2) serving as a potential hydrogen storage medium. In this paper, Fe-Ni catalyst modified three-dimensional graphene was added to MgH2 by ball milling to optimize the hydrogen storage performance, the impacts and mechanisms of which are systematically investigated based on the thermodynamic and kinetic analysis. The MgH2+10 wt%Fe-Ni@3DG composite system can absorb 6.35 wt% within 100 s (300 degrees C, 50 atm H2 pressure) and release 5.13 wt% within 500 s (300 degrees C, 0.5 atm H2 pressure). In addition, it can absorb 6.5 wt% and release 5.7 wt% within 10 min during 7 cycles, exhibiting excellent cycle stability without degradation. The absorption-desorption mechanism of MgH2 can be changed by the synergistic effects of the two catalyst materials, which significantly promotes the improvement of kinetic performance of dehydrogenation process and reduces the hydrogen desorption temperature.

TI  - Enhanced visible-light-assisted photocatalytic hydrogen generation by MoS2/g-C(3)N(4 )nanocomposites
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A facile, one-pot, solvothermal synthesis of MoS2 microflowers (S1) and the heterostructures MoS2/g-C3N4 with varying ratios of 1:1 (S2), 1:2 (S3) and 1:3 (S4) exhibiting enhanced visible-light-assisted H-2 generation by water splitting has been reported. The compounds were thoroughly characterized by PXRD, FESEM, HRTEM, EDS, UV-vis and XPS techniques. FESEM and HRTEM analyses showed the presence of microflowers composed of nano-sized petals in case of pure MoS2 (Si), while the MoS2 microflowers covered with gC(3)N(4) nanosheets in case of MoS2/g-C3N4 heterostructure, S4. XPS analysis of S2 showed the presence of 2H phase of MoS2 with g-C3N4. The Eosin-Y/dye-sensitized visible-lightassisted photocatalytic investigation of the samples in the absence of any noble metal cocatalyst revealed very good water splitting activity of MoS2/g-C3N4 heterostructure, S2 with hydrogen generation rate of 1787 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) which is about 6 and 40 times higher than pure MoS2 and g-C3N4 respectively. The relatively higher catalytic activity of the heterostructure, S2 has been ascribed to the efficient spatial separation of photo-induced charge carriers owing to the synergistic interaction between MoS2 and g-C3N4. A possible mechanism for the Eosin-Y-sensitized photocatalytic H-2 generation activity of MoS2/g-C3N4 heterostructures has also been presented. The enhanced activity of S2 was further supported by fluorescence measurements. Thus, the present study highlights the importance of non-noble metal based MoS2/g-C3N4 heterojunction photocatalysts for efficient visible-light-driven H-2 production from water splitting.

TI  - Development of a ternerry condunting composite (PPy/Au/CNT@Fe3O4) immobilized FRT/GOD bioanode for glucose/oxygen biofuel cell applications
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs) are considered as a promising technology to sustain the requirements of miniaturized portable energy sources. Electrode materials being one of the substantial aspects of EBFCs have stimulated immense interest in research. A new platform made of nanocomposite, involving magnetic particles of iron oxide (Fe3O4), carbon nanotubes (CNT), gold nanoparticles (Au) and a conducting polymer polypyrrole (PPy), was used as the electrode support for the immobilization of glucose oxidase (GOD) which improves the bioelectrocatalysis of the enzyme towards oxidation of glucose. The structural and electrochemical characterization of the modified bioanode GCE/PPy/Au/CNT@Fe3O4/ FRT/GOD was performed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The performance of the bioanode was evaluated with promising results showing the maximum current density of 6.01 mA cm (2) (0.22 V vs. Ag/AgCl) in 40 mM of glucose concentration at 0.38 V open circuit potential (OCV). The results suggested that PPy/Au/ CNT@Fe3O4 nanocomposite significantly improve the surface area of the electrode and served as a suitable environment for enzyme immobilization, and established good electrical communication by facilitating electron transfer between enzymes and electrode surface. The as-synthesized composite has been inferred as a promising platform for improved bioelectrocatalysis owing to the excellent combination of superparamagnetism of Fe3O4 with good electrocatalytic properties of CNT, PPy, and Au nanoparticles. Thus PPy/ Au/CNT@Fe3O4 nanocomposite can be considered as a prospective electrode material for developing better electrochemical biosensors and biofuel cell anode.

TI  - An overview of proton exchange membranes for fuel cells: Materials and manufacturing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Due to their efficient and cleaner operation nature, proton exchange membrane fuel cells are considered energy conversion devices for various applications including transportation. However, the high manufacturing cost of the fuel cell system components remains the main barrier to their general acceptance and commercialization. The main strategy for lowering the cost of fuel cells which is critical for their general acceptance as alternative energy sources in a variety of applications is to lower the cost of the electrolyte and catalyst. An electrolyte is one of the most important components in the fuel cell and a major contributor to the cost (>$500/m(2 ) for commercial Nafion (R)( )series). Nafion is widely used as an electrolyte in PEMs, but it has some limitations in addition to high costs such as low proton conductivity, high-temperature performance degradation, and high fuel crossover. Therefore, the development and manufacturing of low-cost and high-performance electrolyte membranes with higher conductivity (~0.1 S (.)cm (-1)) at a wider temperature range is a top priority in the scientific community. Recent years have seen extensive research on the preparation, modification, and properties of PEMs such as non-Nafion membranes (SPI, PBI, polystyrene, polyphosphazene, SPAEK, SPEEK, SPAS, SPEN), and their composites by incorporating functionalized CNTs, GO as fillers to overcome their drawbacks. This paper provides a comprehensive review of membrane materials and manufacturing with a focus on PEMs. In particular, the review brings out the basic mechanism involved in proton conduction, important requirements, historical background, contending technologies, types, advantages and disadvantages, current developments, future goals, and directions design aspects related to thermodynamic and electrochemical principles, system assessment parameters, and the prospects and outlook.

AB  - The hydrogen-based economy is one of the possible approaches toward to eliminate the problem of global warming, which are increases because of the gathering of greenhouse gases. Palladium (Pd) is well-known material having a strong affinity to the hydrogen absorbing property and thus appropriate material to embed in the membrane for the improvement of selective permeation of hydrogen gas. In present work, we have functionalized polycarbonate (PC) membranes with the help of UV irradiation to embed the Pd nanoparticles in pores as well as on the surface of the PC membrane. Use of Pd Nanoparticles is helpful to enhance the H-2 selectivity over other gases (CO2, N-2, etc.). Also, the UV based modification of membrane increases the attachment of Pd Nanoparticles. Further to enhance the Pd nanoparticles attachment, we used PVP binder with Pd nanoparticles solution. Gas permeability measurements of functionalized PC membranes have been carried out, and better selectivity of hydrogen has been found in the functionalized and Pd nanoparticle binded membrane. PC membrane with 48 h UV irradiated and Pd NPs with PVP have been found to have maximum selectivity and permeability for H2 gas. All the samples being characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy and UV-Vis spectroscopy for their morphological and structural investigation.

CP  - 7th World Hydrogen Technologies Convention (WHTC)

AB  - In present work, we report a facile fabrication process to improve the photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of ZnO-based photoelectrodes. In order to achieve that, the Cu2O nanocubes are cathodic-deposited on the as-prepared ZnO nanorods. Then rGO nano sheets are electrodeposited on the ZnO/Cu2O heterostructures. The fabricated photo electrodes are systematically studied in detail by different characterization techniques such as powder X-ray diffraction, micro-Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ultraviolet diffused reflectance spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy analysis. Morphologies of the fabricated photoelectrodes are investigated through electron microscopy in scanning and transmission mode. To evaluate the PEC performance of the fabricated photoelectrodes, the line scan voltammetry (LSV) measurement is performed using a three-electrode system in 0.5-M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution under stimulated light illumination at 100 mW/cm(2) from a 300-W Xenon Arc lamp coupled with an AM 1.5G filter using a three-electrode system. The photocurrent measurement demonstrates that the photoelectrodes based on ZnO/Cu-2/rGO possess enhanced PEC performance compared to the pristine ZnO and ZnO/Cu2O photoelectrodes. The photocurrent density of ZnO/Cu2O/rGO-15 photoelectrode (10.11 mA/cm(2)) is similar to 9 and similar to 3 times higher than the photoelectrodes based on pristine ZnO (1.06 mA/cm(2)) and ZnO/Cu2O (3.22 mA/cm(2)). The enhanced PEC performance of ZnO/Cu2O/rGO photoelectrode is attributed to the excellent light absorption properties of Cu2O and excellent catalytic and charge transport properties of rGO. Experimental results reveal that the proposed functional nanomaterials have a great potential in water splitting applications. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Graphene confined MoS(2 )particles for accelerated electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - MoS2 is a promising noble-metal-free electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Extensive trials have been carried out to increase its low electrical conductivity and insufficient active sites. Here, a remarkable electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution is developed based on the in-situ preparation of MoS2 confined in graphene nanosheets. Graphene effectively controls the growth of MoS2 and immensely increases the conductivity and structural stability of the composite materials. Remarkably, because of the plentiful active sites, sufficient electrical contact and transport, MoS2 particles confined in graphene nanosheets exhibit an onset overpotential as small as 32 mV, an overpotential approaching 132 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and a low Tafel slope of 45 mV dec(-1). This work presents a reasonable architecture for practical applications in efficient electrocatalytic H-2 generation. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Investigation of the appropriate content of graphene in Ag-TiO2-graphene ternary nanocomposites applied as photocatalysts
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ag-TiO2-graphene ternary nanocomposites with varying graphene contents were fabricated by photocatalytic reduction. SEM and TEM imaging of the nanocomposites showed that TiO2 nanoparticles decorated with Ag nanoparticles covered graphene nanosheets. A higher content of graphene was shown to be favorable for dye photodegradation. The results of electrochemical analysis revealed that a higher graphene content contributed to increased conductivity and reduced interfacial impedance, which led to more efficient electron transport and thus higher photocatalytic activity. The highest efficiency in dye photodegradation and hydrogen production from water splitting was achieved when the ratio of TiO2 to graphene in the nanocomposite was 5: 1. The corresponding mass normalized hydrogen evolution rate and quantum efficiency were 129.5 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) and 4.8%, respectively. A mechanism for photocatalysis was proposed and discussed. This study demonstrates that the Ag-TiO2-graphene ternary nanocomposite could be a promising photocatalyst. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As a multifunctional material with excellent performances, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) and their composites have broad application prospects in energy storage, catalysis, environmental protection, drug release and other fields. In this study, three-dimensional (3-D) graphene-like carbon nanosheets (AGC) were prepared by one-step synthesis method as active carrier materials, and then MnCo-LDHs nanoflowers assembled with ultrafine nanosheets were loaded on them to construct a newly 3-D architecture of AGC/MnCo-LDHs nanocomposites. The nanocomposites were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM and XPS. The composite materials were assembled into OER and ORR electrodes for electrochemical measurements as efficient bifunctional catalysts. The favorable 3-D porous architecture (fast ion diffusion) of MnCo-LDHs and carrier effect of AGC (high electron conductivity) were the key contributing factors for their excellent electrochemical performances of nanocomposites.

TI  - Copper nanoparticles immobilized on a hybrid chitosan derivative-graphite substrate as a novel electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, abundant and cheap graphite support (G) was modified with chitosan (Chit) and amine groups to obtain N-Chit-G and subsequently decorated with copper nanoparticles (CuNPs). The nanocomposites thus obtained were characterized at different stages of the synthesis using various techniques such as transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, carbon-hydrogen nitrogen sulfur analyzer, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Results showed that CuNPs had been uniformly and finely decorated on the N-Chit-G support, in which copper was in the predominant form of Cu(I). The Randles-Sevcik equation revealed the high active surface area of Cu N-Chit-G compared to the remaining composites obtained. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at Cu@N-Chit-G was evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry using a rotating disk electrode in a KOH solution (0.1 mol L-1) saturated with O-2 and O-2 plus MeOH (1.0 mol L-1) to find the good electrocatalytic capability of Cu@N-Chit-G for ORR with a small onset potential of 0.74 V (vs. RHE). A KOH solution, saturated with MeOH (1.0 mol L-1), revealed good 10000 s durability of Cu@N-Chit-G electrocatalyst with a slow drop in the current (91%). Finally, ORR kinetic investigations were conducted using the Koutecky-Levich (K-L) plot to find the ORR progress through a 4e(-) pathway. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Hydrogen production from microbial fuel cells-ammonia electrolysis cell coupled system fed with landfill leachate using Mo2C/N-doped graphene nanocomposite as HER catalyst
T2  - ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we reported hydrogen production from ammonia-rich wastewater using series stacked microbial fuel cells (MFCs)-ammonia electrolytic cell (AEC) coupled system with Mo2C/N-doped graphene (Mo2C/N-rGO) nanocomposite as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst. The electrocatalytic activity of Mo2C/N-rGO nanocomposite towards HER, the performance of simultaneous bioelectricity and hydrogen production as well as landfill leachate treatment of this coupled system were investigated under continuous parallel flow mode. Results demonstrated that four air-cathode MFCs in series stacking harvested the highest power density of 536 mW m(-2) when fed with glucose and ammonium mixture, and meanwhile approximately 59 mu L g(Mo2C/N-rGO)(-1) h(-1) of hydrogen production rate was achieved with continuous bioelectricity supply to the AEC unit. As the substrate was shifted to actual landfill leachate (dilution ratio of 1: 4), only ca. 143 mW m(-2) of maximal output power was obtained from the series stacked MFCs, but it still accomplished 71% NH4+-N removal efficiency and about 42 mu L g(Mo2C/N-rGO)(-1) h(-1) of hydrogen production rate. This MFCs-AEC coupled bio-electrochemical system highlighted its potential for hydrogen production from real landfill leachate along with simultaneous chemical oxygen demand and ammonia-nitrogen removal without the need for external electricity supply, thus achieving the resource and energy re-utilization of ammonia-rich wastewater.

TI  - PtNi and PtMo nanoparticles as efficient catalysts using TEA-PS.BF4 ionic liquid as electrolyte towards HER
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon-supported bimetallic nanoparticles, PtNi/C and PtMo/C, were synthesized using the borohydride reduction method and were tested as cathode in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) employing acid aqueous solution of 3-triethylammonium-propanesulfonic acid tetrafluoroborate (TEA-PS.BF4) ionic liquid as the electrolyte. For comparison a commercial carbon-supported Pt nanoparticles (Pt/C) has been tested. The morphology, composition and structure of the carbon-supported nanoparticles were characterized by EDX, XRD, and TEM. The results obtained by chronoamperometry, Tafel plots and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) exhibited an excellent catalytic effect and the same kinetics mechanism for all carbon-supported nanoparticles in HER studied. Results of Tafel analysis showed that the HER rate determining step is the Volmer Heyrovsky mechanism. In the temperature range 25-80 degrees C, the PtNi/C and PtMo/C cathodes presented lower activation energy and higher current density than system using the Pt/C cathode. The PtMo/C cathode improves charge transfer kinetics and hydrogen adsorption, while the PtNi/C cathode facilitates the desorption step. These results demonstrate that the carbon supported bimetallic nanoparticles PtNi/C and PtMo/C are responsible for increasing the catalytic performances of the HER when TEA-PS.BF4 aqueous solution is employed as electrolyte.

TI  - Titanium-embedded graphene as high-capacity hydrogen-storage media
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a system that has the potential to be a good candidate for hydrogen storage, in which multiple hydrogen molecules can be adsorbed in the ground state around an impurity in graphene at a certain optimal ILD (interlayer distance). Our first-principles calculations predict that this complex, Ti atoms embedded in double-vacancy graphene (Ti@DV), can hold up to eight H-2 per unit. The hydrogen molecules are not dissociated and are all stored in molecular form, so adsorption and desorption of hydrogen should be feasible. Furthermore, this type of structure is stable throughout the charging and discharging process. The density of states (DOS) of this hydrogen storage medium indicates little charge transfer between H-2 and Ti@DV graphene. Copyright (C) 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

TI  - Bimetallic Ag-Ni nanoparticles as an effective catalyst for hydrogen generation from hydrolysis of sodium borohydride
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Stable Ag-Ni bimetallic NPs was prepared, characterized, and applied for the dehydrogenation of sodium borohydride in aqueous media. The structure morphology and properties of Ag-Ni NPs were characterized by using conventional techniques such as surface field scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV-visible spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The Ag-Ni NPs were found to be highly effective catalyst to the hydrogen generation from the hydrolysis of sodium borohydride. The catalytic activity of Ag-Ni was increased with increasing the ratio of Ni (Ag-25-Ni-25 (<) Ag-25-Ni-50 (<) Ag-25-Ni-75). The reaction follows first-order kinetics with respect to [NaBH4]. The apparent activation energy = 16.2 kJ/mol, activation enthalpy = 13.4 kJ/mol, and activation entropy = -135.2 J/K/mol were calculated for the hydrogen generation. The activation energy is much lower than those of the other bimetallic nano catalysts. The excellent catalytic activity, good stability, and low cost make the Ag based Ag-Ni NPs a suitable catalyst for the generation of hydrogen in sodium borohydride hydrolysis. It was found that the Ag-25-Ni-75 is one of the most reusable and durable catalyst for six consecutive cycles without any significant decrease in their catalytic activity.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We report the facile and versatile preparation of graphene-based nanocornposites of magnetite, silver, titania, nickel, and silicon by solid state mechanical mixing. The composites were directly employed for nitrogen and hydrogen gas adsorption studies at 77 K and equilibrium pressure of 1 atm. Under the experimental conditions the chemically synthesised graphene support had a solid state BET surface area of 499 m(2)/g and a total reversible hydrogen uptake of 0.5 wt.%. Among our prepared nanocomposite samples, the silver nanoparticles promoted the most significant increase in hydrogen uptake per metre squared of material by 30% when compared to the parent graphene sample. However, the total hydrogen uptake by weight percentage in the studied graphenic materials remains low. The hydrogen storage capacity observed for the graphene nanocomposites can be qualitatively accounted for by considering the contributions of the catalyst particles on the hydrogen storage, the contact between catalyst and graphene, and the structural nature of the graphene surface.

TI  - A bi-functional polymeric nano-sieve Nafion composite membrane: Improved performance for direct methanol fuel cell applications
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A polyamide macromolecular proton conductor with COOH end-capped is used as a bi-functional polymeric nano-sieve (BFPS) in composite Nafion membranes to simultaneously improve the proton conductivity and suppress the methanol permeation. With 1%-5% incorporation of the BFPS into the composite Nafion membrane, not only the proton conductivity and the methanol-permeation resistivity are improved, but also stronger mechanical strength is obtained, compared to the pure Nafion membrane. We show that the membrane with a 5% BFPS content gives the optimal performance and the composite membrane is well suited for applications in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). The DMFC performance of the membrane is found to be more than 60% better than the performance of a recast pure Nafion membrane. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this work, a fast and easy synthesis of graphene sheets by mild tip-ultrasonic method was developed. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) was used as dispersion media. Ultrasonic time effect on the graphene properties was investigated (30, 60 and 120 min). Additionally, graphene was doped by solvothermal treatment to obtain nitrogen-doped graphene metal-free electrocatalysts (NG). Raman spectra results indicated the formation of graphene-like carbon nanosheets composed by a mixture of few and multilayer sheets with a defective lattice. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis show that nitrogen atoms were successfully doped into graphene structures with an atomic percentage (%oat.) in the range of 2.76-3.69. Electrochemical evaluation revealed that these materials are electroactive for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media. The NG60 metal-free electrocatalyst is of particular interest because it showed the best performance with a limit current of 1.1 mA cm(-2) and an on-set potential of 0.73 V vs. RHE. Therefore, the sonochemical synthesis is an attractive massively scalable method to obtain graphene to be applied in alternative energy systems. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY

AB  - Transition metals have attracted particular research interest for sustainable ORR electrocatalysis but zero-valent ones have been often ignored. In this work metallic cobalt nanoparticle decorated graphene aerogel (CoNPs/rGO aerogel) was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal reaction, followed by thermal annealing in reducing H-2 atmosphere. As prepared CoNPs/rGO aerogel demonstrates commercial Pt/C-comparable ORR activity through a predominant four-electron pathway, as well as excellent durability and methanol tolerance superior to Pt/C in alkaline medium. This work suggests that metallic cobalt nanoparticle is highly efficient to boost the ORR activity of neighboring carbon besides various cobalt compounds. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Enhanced photoelectrochemical water splitting characteristics of TiO2 hollow porous spheres by embedding graphene as an electron transfer channel
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The generation of renewable solar fuel through photoelectrochemical water splitting is hindered by the inability to identify the right material with the optimum optical, electrical and chemical characteristics. Herein, we demonstrate the ability to fabricate TiO2 hollow porous spheres (HPS)/graphene (Gr) hybrid composite photoanodes for use in solar fuel generation cells. The fabricated materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL), scanning electron microscopy and electrochemical techniques. Upon the use of the TiO2 HPS/Gr photoanodes to split water photoelectrochemically under AM 1.5 illumination in 1.0 M KOH aqueous electrolyte, the performance increased with increasing the Gr content, showing a ten-fold increase in the photocurrent for the photoanode containing 5% Gr (1.449 mA cm(-2)) as compared to bare TiO2 HPS (0.143 mA cm(-2)). This enhancement is attributed to the effect of Gr in suppressing the recombination of charge carriers, as supported by the PL measurements and the decrease in the dark current upon the addition of Gr, which acts as an electron acceptor and transports electrons more efficiently. Moreover, the transient photocurrent (J-t) tests confirm the stability of the hybrid photoanodes. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Graphene-titanium dioxide (TiO2) materials were prepared using titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) and graphite oxides (GO) via a simple and continuous vapor reaction process. TiO2 nanoparticles obtained from the reaction assembled into clusters loading on graphene or attached onto graphene individually to form graphene-TiO2 nanocomposites. Graphene not only could enhance the nanocomposite electric conductivity but also is useful to improve the material porosity. The nanocomposites exhibited an enhanced performance for Na-ion battery anode with a specific capacity of 115 mAhg(-1) at a current of 1 A/g and a stable specific capacity of 102 mAhg(-1) at 0.1 A/g after 300 cycles.

TI  - Immobilization of glucose oxidase on 3D graphene thin film: Novel glucose bioanalytical sensing platform
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Electrochemical biosensors are responsible for quantification of analytes for medical diagnostics applications. They are considered as a promising means to investigate the content of a biological sample owing to the direct exchange of a biological process to an electronic output signal. Novel characteristics of nanocarbon materials attracted much attention for fabrication of numerous electrochemical biosensors with developed analytical capacities. This paper aims to provide perceptions of 3D graphene-based electrochemical biosensors and to demonstrate its application in glucose detection. The developed glucose biosensing platform exhibits excellent catalytic activity towards glucose detection over a wide linear range of up to 6 mM with sensitivity of 1.63 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) and the stability of electrode is around 76.9% after one month. The facile and easy electrochemical approach used for the preparation of 3DG-GOD modified GCE may open up new horizons in the production of cost-effective biosensors.

TI  - Diatom frustule-graphene based nanomaterial for room temperature hydrogen storage
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Development of a room temperature hydrogen storage material is vital for the realization of a hydrogen economy. Towards achieving this goal, we present the use of naturally occurring diatom frustule for the synthesis of a novel nanomaterial that can achieve a hydrogen storage capacity of similar to 4.83 wt% at 25 degrees C and similar to 20 bar H-2 equilibrium pressure. We have effectively combined the large surface area of few layer graphene(G), the unique physical and chemical properties of diatom frustules(D) such as chemical inertness and good porosity and the ability of transition metals and their alloys (Pd3Co) to adsorb large amounts of hydrogen. The resulting nanomaterial (Pd3Co-D(100)-G) has a surface area of 163.25 m(2)/g and pore volume of 0.84 cm(3)/g. The observations in the present study suggest that increased surface area and porosity play a key role in achieving high hydrogen storage capacity at relatively low H-2 equilibrium pressures and room temperature conditions.

TI  - S, N co-doped graphene quantum dots decorated TiO2 and supported with carbon for oxygen reduction reaction catalysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sluggish kinetics and catalyst instability in oxygen reduction reaction are the central issues in fuel cell and metal-air battery technologies. For that, highly active, stable, and low-cost non-platinum based electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction are an immediate requirement in fuel cell and metal-air battery technologies. A new composite (S,N-GQD/TiO2/C-800) is synthesized, made of sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) co-doped graphene quantum dot (GQD) with TiO2. This composite is supported on carbon on heating at 800 degrees C under N-2 atmosphere and is explored for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst. The synthesized composite S,N-GQD/TiO2/C-800, shows outstanding catalytic activity with an onset potential of 0.91 V and a half-wave potential of 0.82 V vs. RHE, an alkaline medium. The Tafel slope of the catalyst is 61 mV dec(-1). The catalyst is an excellent methanol tolerant and shows good stability in an alkaline medium. The excellent ORR activity of S,N-GQD/TiO2/C-800 is ascribed to well-built interactivity between the S,N-GQD/TiO2, and the carbon support. The unique structure offers advantages, with outstanding electrical conductivity, high surface area, and excellent charge transfer kinetics between the doped GQD and TiO2 interface and subsequently from the carbon surface to the S,N-GQD/TiO2.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Herein, we present a simple, large-scale and low-cost process to develop hierarchically porous NeS co-doped 3D wrinkled graphene like nanosheets (3D H-GNS) from carbonization of biomass Tender palm shoots and NaHCO3. Non-corrosive and non-toxic Na2CO3 acts as a reaction mean to control the activation process, developing 3D H-GNS with a high specific surface area of 2095 m(2) g(-1). A 3D H-GNS-900 electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 529 F g-1 (1.5 A g(-1)) and 330 F g(-1) (1 A g(-1)) in1MH(2)SO(4) for 3-electrode and 2-electrode systems respectively. Further, a longer cycle life with 93% capacitance retention over 10,000 cycles at 5 A g(-1) is realized. Also, we are successful in fabricating biocompatible solid-state flexible supercapacitor device with 3D H-GNS-900 electrodes in organic electrolyte with 3 V voltage range, demonstrating to run a toy fan and lightning a LED for 15 min after charging for 60 s.

TI  - Borocarbonitrides as Metal-Free Catalysts for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction
T2  - ADVANCED MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrogen generation by water splitting is clearly a predominant and essential strategy to tackle the problems related to renewable energy. In this context, the discovery of proper catalysts for electrochemical and photochemical water splitting assumes great importance. There is also a serious intent to eliminate platinum and other noble metal catalysts. To replace Pt by a non-metallic catalyst with desirable characteristics is a challenge. Borocarbonitrides, (BxCyNz) which constitutes a new class of 2D material, offer great promise as non-metallic catalysts because of the easy tunability of bandgap, surface area, and other electronic properties with variation in composition. Recently, BxCyNz composites with excellent electrochemical and photochemical hydrogen generation activities have been found, especially noteworthy being the observation that BxCyNz with a carbon-rich composition or its nanocomposites with MoS2 come close to Pt in electrocatalytic properties, showing equally good photochemical activity.

TI  - Fabrication and enhanced supercapacitive performance of graphene/nano-carbide derived carbon composites
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introducing carbon nanotube (CNT) or carbon black (CB) among graphene sheets has been demonstrated an effective strategy to impede the restacking of graphene sheets and eventually enhances the supercapacitive performance. However, due to their relatively low specific surface area (SSA) and undeveloped pores, the introduced CNT or CB itself has limited contribution to the electrochemical performance. To address the problem, we have synthesized a graphene/nanometer-sized carbide-derived carbon (graphene/nano-CDC) composite. Benefiting from the introduction of the porous nano-CDC, the graphene/nano-CDC composite behaves higher SSA and developed pore structure, and thus superior supercapacitive performance. The specific capacitance of the graphene/nano-CDC composite can reach 195 F g(-1) at a scan rate of 5 mV s(-1), a 179% increase compared with RGO (only 70 F g(-1)). Most interestingly, even at the scan rate of 5000 mV s(-1), its cyclic voltammogram curves can still keep a relatively typical rectangle shape and the capacitance retention can maintain 67% (130 F g(-1)), approximately 5 times higher than those of the RGO (13%, 9 F g(-1)). In addition, the specific capacitance of the graphene/nano-CDC composite is quite stable over the entire cycle numbers, and has no significant degradation even after 10,000 cycles.

TI  - Novel activated carbon supported trimetallic PdCoAg nanoparticles as efficient catalysts for the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Activated carbon (AC) supported palladium, cobalt and silver nanoparticle (PdCoAg/AC) catalysts were prepared by in situ reduction of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) and characterized by various techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The PdCoAg/AC catalyst is active in the hydrolysis of ammonia-borane (AB) even at low temperatures. Compared with mono- (Pd) and bi-metallic (PdCo) nanoparticles, this trimetallic (PdCoAg) structure showed greatly increased catalytic activity for AB hydrolysis. Their hydrolysis completion time was 50 s. This study also included full experimental details of kinetic data to determine the activation parameters (Ea, Delta H and Delta S) for the rate law and the catalytic hydrolysis of AB. In addition, the PdCoAg/AC catalysts had favorable catalytic activity also after seven runs. Hydrogen generation rate (HG), Ea, Delta H and Delta S were obtained at 25 degrees C as 4666.66 mL min(-1)g(-1) (2 mmol AB and 50 mg PdCoAg/AC), 26.836 kJ mol(-1), 29.416 kJ mol(-1) and -108.42 J mol(-1)K(-1), respectively. In addition, the study showed that Pd0.6Co0.2CAg0.2/AC (Pd:Co:Ag atomic ratio = 6:2:2) showed the total turnover frequency (TOF) value of 6624 h(-1). These results demonstrate that the PdCoAg/AC catalyst is a promising alternative in search of the practical application of AB as a hydrogen storage material for fuel cell applications.

It showed excellent specific capacitance (3632.0 F g(-1) at 1.0 A ge(-1)) as electrode of supercapacitor for GQD@PANi nanocomposites with 10.0 wt%. The result was attributed to PANi with more benzenoid structure, which provided more electrochemical active sites and reduced internal resistance under assistant with GQD.

TI  - Recent advances in designing and tailoring nanofiber composite electrolyte membranes for high-performance proton exchange membrane fuel cells
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Review
AB  - As the critical component of proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), proton exchange membrane (PEM) determine its overall performance. Current PEMs hardly meet the operating requirements of fuel cells, limiting their commercial applications. With the development of nanocomposite technology, nanofibers introduced into PEMs to prepare nanofiber composite proton exchange membranes (NCPEMs) have been widely studied. In an NCPEM, nanofibers can form long-range channels for proton transport, and reinforced skeleton to reach the target performance of PEMFCs. Focusing on NCPEM, this paper reviews on recent progresses in nanofiber preparation and NCPEM preparation techniques. Furthermore, different types of nanofibers incorporated into NCPEMs are reviewed in terms of fiber composition. The challenges and future perspectives regarding NCPEMs are also discussed.

AB  - The paper reports synthesis of CdS supported rGO where reduction of GO to rGO was carried out electrochemically in situ. This catalyst had a better activity for photoelectrochemical dissociation of water to hydrogen. Catalysts were characterized by XRD, FTIR, DRS, XPS, EIS and Mott-Schottky analysis. It is reported that this catalyst showed formation of heterojunction at the interface of CdS and rGO by chemical interaction between the two. This resulted in a greater band bending, a higher charge carrier density, low resistance for electronic mobility and low recombination rate. A better activity of the catalyst is due to the above mentioned attributes. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We report a self-standing NiFe layered double hydroxide/nitrogen doped graphite foam (NiFe LDH/NGF) electrode for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) prepared via a facile electrodeposition method. The electrode showed high electrocatalytic activity towards OER, exhibiting a low onset overpotential of 0.239 V and a small Tafel slope of 57.9 mV dec(-1) in basic electrolytes, as well as a good stability during the long-term cycling test. The outstanding electrocatalytic activity is mainly attributed to the synergy between the abundant catalytically active sites through good dispersion of NiFe LDH across NGF and fluent electron transport arising from NGF.

TI  - One-pot synthesis of MoS2/In2S3 ultrathin nanoflakes with mesh-shaped structure on indium tin oxide as photocathode for enhanced photo-and electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction
T2  - APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A bifunctional MoS2/In2S3 hybrid composite that has both photo-and electrocatalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is prepared by a facile one pot hydrothermal method. The characterizations by scanning electron microscope (SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) and Photoluminescence (PL) shows that the MoS2/In2S3 hybrid exhibits ultrathin nanoflakes with mesh-shaped structure on transparent conductive substrates, and the as prepared catalyst composite obviously improves the separation of electro-hole pairs. The as prepared hybrid nanosheets with Mo: In of 1/2 integrate In-doped MoS2 to reduce the stacking and increase the active surface area. The novel mesh-shaped nanostructure with a moderate degree of disorder provides not only simultaneously intrinsic conductivity and defects but also higher electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). By electrochemical measurements, such as linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscope (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV), we find that the MoS2/In2S3 hybrid possesses much better photo/electrochemical activity than pristine MoS2 or In2S3. MoS2/In2S3 ultrathin nanoflaks are anticipated to be a superior photoelectrocatalyst for PEC cells, and the rational use of the MoS2/In2S3 cathode offers a new avenue toward achieving effective photo-assistant electrocatalytic activity.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A self-supporting graphene (SSG) was prepared by electrochemical re-intercalation of a flexible graphite sheet (FGS) in the (NH4)(2)S2O8 electrolyte. The in-situ grown SSG rooted in the unexpanded FGS substrate which acted as a current collector. A thin, homogeneous and conformal MnO2 layer was coated on the surface of SSG by microwave-assisted deposition. The obtained FGS-SSG/MnO2 electrode displayed the areal and specific capacitances as high as 2.8 F cm(-2) and 465 F g(-1) at 2 mV s. An asymmetric supercapacitor of FGS-SSG/MnO21/FGS-SSG was assembled, which exhibited a maximum energy density of 25.6 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 1000W kg(-1). In addition, the capacitance retention ratio of FGS-SSG/MnO2//FGS-SSG reached 87% at the current density of 1 A g(-1) after 5000 charge discharge cycles. High electrochemical properties indicate that the FGS-SSG/MnO2 is a promising electrode for supercapacitors. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Enzymatic biofuel cells are a subclass of biofuel cells, which employ enzymes to generate energy from renewable sources. In this study, 3-dimensional graphene (3DG)/glucose oxidase (GOx) bio-nanocomposite was fabricated in order to improve enzyme immobilisation and enzyme lifetime with an enhanced electron transfer rate. These enhancements are due to the unique physical properties of 3DG, e.g. high porosity, large surface area, and excellent electrical conductivity. A power density of 164 mu W cm(-2) at 0.4 V was achieved from this enzymatic biofuel cell (EBFC) with an acceptable performance compared to that of the other glucose biofuel cells (GBFCs). The 3DG enhances the enzyme lifetime, decreases enzyme leaking and, due to its good conductivity, facilitates the electron harvest and transfer from the enzyme active site to the electrode. This suggests that 3DG could be used as effective support for enzyme immobilisation on the surface of the electrode in EBFC applications and related areas such as biosensors, bioreactors and implantable biofuel cells.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the study presented herein a rapid microwave heating method was used to prepare the graphene supported PtCo catalysts with Pt:Co molar ratio 1:7, 1:22 and 1:44. The transmission electron microscopy was employed to characterize the catalysts. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry was used for estimation of Pt and Co metal loadings. The electrocatalytic activity of the synthesized catalysts towards the oxidation of borohydride was investigated by means of cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The kinetics of the catalytic hydrolysis of NaBH4 in the presence of the synthesized catalysts was investigated.It has been determined that the synthesized graphene supported PtCo catalysts show an enhanced electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of H-2 generated by catalytic hydrolysis of BH4- and direct oxidation of BH4- ions comparing with the graphene supported bare Pt catalyst and graphene supported bare Co catalyst. The graphene supported PtCo catalyst having the Pt:Co molar ratio 1:44 exhibits the highest electrocatalytic activity for the both oxidation reactions of H-2 and BH4- ions.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The rational design of cost-effective and high-activity electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a crucial field of research for achieving the best way to promote "green energy". Here, we develop a simple route to prepare nanohybrids of three-dimensional graphene loading MoO2-Mo2C nanoparticles (MoO2-Mo2C/G), which were characterized using X-ray diffractometer (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), demonstrating the MoO2-Mo2C/G has unique features with high conductivity, robust structure, and high surface area. The as-developed MoO2-Mo2C/G nanohybrid shows great potential to replace Pt-based electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to its cheapness, high catalytic activity and considerable stability.

TI  - Synthesis of Au/UiO-66-NH2/Graphene composites as efficient visible-light photocatalysts to convert CO2
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The production of new solar fuel through CO2 photocatalytic reduction has aroused tremendous attention in recent years because of the increased demand of global energy sources and global warming caused by the mass concentration of CO2 in the earth's atmosphere. In this work, UiO-66-NH2 was co-modified by the Au nanoparticles (Au-NPs) and Graphene (GR). The resultant nanocomposite exhibits a strong absorption edge in visible light owing to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of Au-NPs. More attractively, Au/UiO66-NH2/GR displays much higher photocatalytic activity (49.9 mmol) and selectivity (80.9%) than that of UiO-66-NH2/GR (selectivity: 71.6%) and pure UiO-66-NH2 (selectivity: 38.3%) for the CO2 reduction under visible light. The enhanced photocatalytic performance is primarily dued to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of Au-NPs, which could enhance the visible light absorption. The GR sheets could play as an electron acceptor with superior conductivity and thus suppress the recombination of electrons and holes. Besides, the GR could also improve the dispersibility of UiO-66-NH2 so as to expose more active sites and strengthen the capture of CO2. The contact effect and synergy effect among different samples are strengthened in the ternary composites and the photocatalytic performance is therefore improved. This study demonstrates a MOF based hybrid composite for efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction, the findings not only prove great potential for the design and application of MOFs-based materials but also bring light to novel chances in the development of new high performance photocatalysts.

TI  - Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution on graphene quantum dots anchored TiO2 nanotubes-array
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The inversely structured TiO2 nanotubes-array (TiO2-NA) and CdS-modified TiO2 nanotubes-array (CdS/TiO2-NA) with graphene quantum dots (GQDs) anchored inside were prepared through a facile impregnation method. The catalysts were characterized by multiple techniques of SEM, TEM, XRD, Raman spectroscopy, XPS, TG and diffuse reflectance UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy. The results of TEM, XPS and Raman spectroscopy indicate that the GQDs were really formed and successfully anchored into the TiO2-NA and CdS/TiO2-NA. The activity evaluation results show that the hydrogen evolution rate during photocatalytic water splitting was greatly improved after loading GQDs into TiO2-NA and CdS/TiO2-NA. By breaking graphene into GQDs, the light-filtering effect of graphene was remarkably inhibited as compared with that of conventional large graphene sheets. Moreover, the overall morphology of TiO2 nanotube array could be well maintained after anchoring GQDs inside, which is favorable to mass transfer. The catalyst design strategy proposed in present work can be extended to other photocatalytic systems. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - In situ fabrication of porous graphene electrodes for high-performance lithium-oxygen batteries
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - These years, Li-O-2 batteries attract wide interest because of its high theoretical energy density. However, the catalytic activity and porous structure of cathode remains a great challenge. In this work, we developed a hierarchical porous graphene foam to serve as a battery cathode, which has much richer active sites for cathodic reaction and channels for Li+ transfer and O-2 diffusion. The cathode exhibits a superior specific capacity as high as 9559 mAh g(-1) at 57 mA g(-1) and remains a high-rate capability of 3988 mAh g(-1) at an increased current density of 285 mA g(-1). Benefiting from the well-designed cathode structure, the battery can be stably operated for 150 cycles with a stable voltage profile and voltage efficiency up to 65%. The well-designed graphene has a potential to be a superior free-standing cathode to other carbon-based materials due to its good combination of its hierarchical and porous structure, large surface area, abundant defects and excellent mechanical stability.

TI  - Controllable hydrogen adsorption and desorption by strain modulation on Ti decorated defective graphene
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrogen storage with Ti decorated nano-materials is attributed to the d levels of Ti with unsaturated bonding, whose configuration significantly affects the system's stability and activity. Using first-principles calculations, we have investigated hydrogen adsorption and desorption on the Ti decorated defective graphene under various strains (from 0% to 15%), in which Ti atoms dispersing are energetically stable. According to the phase diagram, we showed that hydrogen uptake can be modulated as a function of chemical potential and strain, since the strain modifies the configuration of d levels, and consequently affects the binding between H-2 and Ti atom. Remarkably, Ti decorated defective graphene under 15% strain could be considered as an ideal media of hydrogen storage, in which the desorption temperature of H-2 is expected to be similar to 300 K at 0.5 atm. The control of strain is found to be dominant to the H-2 uptake, besides the temperature and pressure. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Synergetic catalysis of CuO and graphene additives on TiO2 for photocatalytic water splitting
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A highly efficient and visible-light-responsive CuO/TiO2-GR photocatalyst had been synthesized by a two-step process. The as-prepared CuO/TiO2-GR composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction, N-2-physisorption, transmission electron microscope, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectra, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra and Photoluminescence spectra. The results indicated that a chemical bond formed between GR and TiO2 in CuO/TiO2-GR composites. CuO/TiO2-GR composites had a higher photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production due to a synergistic effect between CuO and GR. The synergistic effect could efficiently suppress charge recombination, improve interfacial charge transfer, enhance visible-light adsorption and provide plentiful phtotocatalytic reaction active sites. The maximum hydrogen evolution rate of CuO/TiO2-GR-0.5 was 2905.60 mu mol/(h.g), which was 20.20 times larger than pure P25. Copyright (c) 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

TI  - Enhancement of the electrochemical performance of free-standing graphene electrodes with manganese dioxide and ruthenium nanocatalysts for lithium-oxygen batteries
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hybrid ternary Graphene/Ruthenium/alpha-MnO2 (rGO/Ru/alpha-MnO2) flexible nanocomposite cathodes were fabricated via controlling both reduction and vacuum filtration processes without using a binder and conductive carbon additives for flexible Li-air battery system. To compare the electrochemical performance of the Graphene/Ruthenium/alpha-MnO2 cathodes, bare rGO and rGO/Ru free-standing cathodes were also manufactured. rGO cathodes with well-dispersed alpha-MnO2 nanowires and ruthenium nanoparticles were successfully synthesized and shown to dramatically increase (decrease) oxygen reduction (evolution) reactions. The enhancement on the electrochemical performance of the synthesized cathodes was attributed not only to catalysis effect of rutheniumand alpha-MnO2 but also well-stacked morphology of the nanocomposite architecture which enables increased oxygen flow between the layers and, hence boosted reaction kinetics.Physical characterization of the cathodes was carried out using FESEM, EDS, TEM, XRD, XPS and Raman spectroscopy. The discharge product of the cathodes was also evaluated using TEM and XPS. Electrochemical performances of the cathodes were evaluated by means of CV, EIS, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical cycling tests. Thanks to the synergetic effect of Ruthenium and alpha-MnO2 catalysts, our ternary rGO/Ru/alpha-MnO2 cathodes were shown to serve full discharge capacity of 2225 mAh/g while rGO/Ru can deliver only 1670 mAh/g. Besides, the cycling stability of the ternary rGO/Ru/alpha-MnO2 cathodes was shown for 50 cycles at 650 mAh/g capacity limited tests in assembled LieO(2) batteries.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Binary nano-composites of palladium and a metal (Fe or Cu) manganite on graphene nanosheets (GNS) have been prepared by a microwave-assisted polyol reduction method and investigated as electrocatalysts for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in 1 M KOH at 25 degrees C. Structural and electrocatalytic surface characterizations of composites are carried out by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron microscopy, cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. Results show that new composite catalysts, particularly 40 wt%Pd-x wt%FeMn2O4/GNS (where x = 5, 8, 10 & 15) are MOR active and that the activity is the greatest with the catalyst containing 8 wt% of the oxide. The composite, Pd-8 wt%FeMn2O4/GNS, exhibits much superior catalytic activity as well as stability compared to the base (Pd/GNS) electrode. The enhanced catalytic activity and stability of the Pd/GNS catalyst in presence of the oxide can be ascribed to increased population of adsorbed OH- ions/OH radicals at the electrode surface.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study a two-dimensional graphene sheet (GS) doped with palladium (Pd) nanoparticles was physically mixed with a superactivated carbon (AC) receptor and used as a hydrogen adsorbent. The hydrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm of the Pd-doped GS catalyst/AC composite (Pd-GS/AC) is determined using a static volumetric measurement at room temperature (RT) and pressure up to 8 MPa. The experiments show that the H-2 uptake capacity of 0.82wt.% for Pd-GS/AC is obviously enhanced, measuring 49% more than the 0.55wt.% for Pd-free GS/AC at RT and 8 MPa. Highly reversible behavior of Pd-GS/AC is also observed. Moreover, the isosteric heat of adsorption for Pd-GS/AC (-14 to -10 kJ/mol) is higher than that for pristine AC (-8 kJ/mol). An increase in H-2 uptake in the Pd-GS/AC suggests the occurrence of a relatively strong interaction between the spilt-over H and the receptor sites due to the spillover effect.

TI  - Boosting the kinetics of oxygen and hydrogen evolution in alkaline water splitting using nickel ferrite/N-graphene nanocomposite as a bifunctional electrocatalyst
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Design, synthesize and application of metal-oxide based bifunctional electrocatalysts with sustainability and efficient activity in water splitting is significant among the wide spread researches in energy applications. Herein, bifunctional electrocatalysts composed of NiFe2O4 dispersed on N-doped graphene has been prepared by in-situ polymerization and characterized for further bifunctional catalytic performances. The electrocatalyst exhibited bespoken performances as cathode in HER as well as anode in OER at alkaline electrolyte. The nanocomposite N-doped graphene/NiFe2O4 (NGNF) exhibited low overpotential of 184 mV in HER and 340 mV in OER for attaining the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) which is far better than their pristine counterparts. Similarly its Tafel slopes were found to be 82.9 mV/dec and 93.2 mV/dec for HER and OER. As an electrocatalyst NGNF outperformed pure nickel ferrite and graphene/NiFe2O4 (GNF) as bifunctional electrocatalyst with low overpotential and Tafel slopes. This indicates the impact of graphene and N-doping on graphene in the activity of pure NF. The graphene in the composite and the N-dopants provoked the catalytic activity and tuned the electron transfer and interaction with the electrolyte. Thus, herein we endow with strategies of preparing highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts by coupling spinel oxides and N-doped graphene for HER and OER.

TI  - Characteristics of resistivity-type hydrogen sensing based on palladium-graphene nanocomposites
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We describe the characteristics of resistivity-type hydrogen (H-2) sensors made of palladium (Pd)-graphene nanocomposites. The Pd-graphene composite was synthesized by a simple chemical route capable of large production. Synthesis of Pd nanoparticles (PdNPs) of various sizes decorated on graphene flakes were easily controlled by varying the concentration of Pd precursors. Resistivity H-2 sensors were fabricated from these Pd-graphene composites and evaluated with various concentrations of H-2 and interfering gases at different temperatures. Characteristics for sensitivity, selectivity, response time and operating life were studied. The results from testing the Pd-graphene indicated a potential for hydrogen sensing materials at low temperature with good sensitivity and selectivity. Specifically H-2 was measurable with concentrations ranging from 1 to 1000 ppm in laboratory air, with a very low detection limit of 0.2 ppm. The response of the sensors is almost linear. The resistivity of sensors changed approximately 7% in its resistance with 1000 ppm H-2 even at room temperature. The robust mechanical properties of graphene, which supported these PdNPs, exhibit structural stability and durability in H-2 sensors for at least six months. Moreover, the advantages in this work are experimental reproducibility in synthesis Pd-graphene composite and sensor fabrication process. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

M3  - Article
AB  - Development of stable and optically active composite film that can show efficient supercapacitor activity is a challenging research interest in material science. A polymer nanocomposite film composed of a green synthesised graphene quantum dot (GQD, G) doped polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and polyaniline (PANI) systems, designated as PAN-PANI@G, have been prepared. The critical loading concentration of prepared composite and its effect on the physicochemical, optical and electrical analysis were systematically studied in detail. PAN-PANI@G composite showed an appreciable electrical conductivity (2.362 x 10(-6) S m(-1)) and optical absorbance at A lambda(max) similar to 270 nm. Physicochemical characterizations by XRD, FTIR and TEM analysis reveal chemical interaction between the individual components via intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Analysed particle size of GQD in the polymer membrane was found to be about two times lesser than that of the pure GQD highlighting synergic interaction between the individual GQD and PAN/PANI matrix. A specific capacitance value of the polymer composites that have been modified on screen-printed carbon electrode were tested by cyclic voltammetric and galvanostatic charge-discharge techniques in 0.1 M H2SO4 solution. Calculated supercapacitor values at an applied current density, 670 mA g(-1)- are in a range of 105-587 F g(-1) cm(-2) which are approximately 2-1300 times higher than the values reported for polypyrrole and polyaniline based polymer composite film in the literature. As a preliminary extension of this study, the optimal PAN/PANI@G nanocomposite of GQD loading, 1.5 wt% was extended to prototype supercapacitor cell application in combination with a dilute solution of NaCl along with suitable conducting plates. When 3 V DC power was supplied for 4 min, the prototype cell produced an operating voltage of 1.4 V for 1 h of operating time. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Polyaniline@spherical ordered mesoporous carbon/sulfur nanocomposites for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lithium-sulfur batteries have attracted a lot of attention in the recent years. However, the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur batteries is greatly affected owing to several issues. In this paper, we designed a polyaniline@spherical ordered mesoporous carbon/sulfur nanocomposite (PANI@S-OMC/S), and S-OMC/S was wrapped by PANI via in-situ polymerization. The inherently conducting nature of PANI increased conductivity of PANI@S-OMC/S electrode to improve the free transfer of electrons, and PANI shell also provided a barrier between the lithium polysulfides and electrolyte to further prevent the occurrence of the "shuttle effect". Moreover, mesoporous pores are wonderful hosts to contain sulfur to trap the long-chain lithium polysulfides and prevent them from dissolving in electrolyte. A high initial discharge capacity of 1626 mAh/g was achieved for the PANI S-OMC/S electrode in first cycle at 0.1 C, and the composite maintains 1338 mAh/g after 100 cycles while the coulombic efficiency still remains-98%.

TI  - Improving the performance of direct methanol fuel cells by implementing multilayer membranes blended with cellulose nanocrystals
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Methanol crossover through the proton exchange membranes of a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) significantly affects its performance and efficiency. Low methanol permeability and high proton conductivity of the membrane is desired for optimum performance. In this work, a multilayer (ML) membrane configuration prepared by a simple pressing technique is employed with and without the incorporation of sprayed cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) to achieve enhanced membrane properties. Assembled multilayer electrolytes show 19% enhanced maximum power density, while the addition of 1.5 wt% CNC (wt % of total final membrane) further improves the performance, giving a 38% better performance compared to standard Nafion N115. Methanol flux density and electrochemical impedance measurements attribute these improvement to the -20% enhancement in the proton conductivity for the multilayer membrane which is enhanced further by an 11% reduction in methanol crossover when the cellulose nanocrystals are added.

TI  - An enhanced proton conductivity and reduced methanol permeability composite membrane prepared by sulfonated covalent organic nanosheets/Nafion
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sulfonated covalent organic nanosheets (SCONs) with a functional group (-SO3H) are effective at reducing ion channels length and facilitating proton diffusion, indicating the potential advantage of SCONs in application for proton exchange membranes (PEMs). In this study, Nafion-SCONs composite membranes were prepared by introducing SCONs into a Nafion membrane. The incorporation of SCONs not only improved proton conductivity, but also suppressed methanol permeability. This was due to the even distribution of ion channels, formed by strong electrostatic interaction between the well dispersed SCONs and Nafion polymer molecules. Notably, Nafion-SCONs-0.6 was the best choice of composite membranes. It exhibited enhanced performance, such as high conductivity and low methanol permeability. The direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) with Nafion-SCONs-0.6 membrane also showed higher power density (118.2 mW cm(-2)), which was 44% higher than the cell comprised of Nafion membrane (81.9 mW cm(-2)) in 2 M methanol at 60 degrees C. These results enabled us to work on building composite membranes with enhanced properties, made from nanomaterials and polymer molecules.

TI  - Layered MoS2-graphene composites for supercapacitor applications with enhanced capacitive performance
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Layered molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) graphene composite is synthesized by a modified L-cysteine-assisted solution-phase method. The structural characterization of the composites by energy dispersive X-ray analysis, X-ray powder diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, XPS, Raman, and transmission electron microscope indicates that layered MoS2 graphene coalescing into three-dimensional sphere-like architecture. The electrochemical performances of the composites are evaluated by cyclic voltammogram, galvanostatic charge discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Electrochemical measurements reveal that the maximum specific capacitance of the MoS2-graphene electrodes reaches up to 243 F g(-1) at a discharge current density 1 A g(-1). The energy density is 73.5 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 19.8 kW kg(-1). The MoS2 graphene composites electrode shows good long-term cyclic stability (only 7.7% decrease in specific capacitance after 1000 cycles at a current density of 1 A g(-1)). The enhancement in specific capacitance and cycling stability is believed to be due to the 3D MoS2 graphene interconnected conductive network which promotes not only efficient charge transport and facilitates the electrolyte diffusion, but also prevents effectively the volume expansion/contraction and aggregation of electroactive materials during charge discharge process. Taken together, this work indicates MoS2 graphene composites are promising electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 40 wt%Pd-x wt%MnMoO4/Graphene (GNS) (0 <= x <= 20) hybrids have been synthesized for use as efficient and CO poisoning tolerant anode materials in methanol fuel cells. Investigations revealed that the addition of MnMoO4 increases the electrocatalytic activity of the base electrode (40 wt%Pd/GNS) towards the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in 1 M KOH significantly. The catalytic activity of the electrode is found to be the greatest with 8 wt%MnMoO4. The addition of MnMoO4 also improves CO poisoning tolerance of the base electrode by 11-73%. The MOR activity and CO poisoning tolerance of the 40 wt%Pd-8 wt% MnMoO4/GNS hybrid electrode were superior to other electrodes of the investigation.

TI  - Co0.85Se on three-dimensional hierarchical porous graphene-like carbon for highly effective oxygen evolution reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Designing an efficient, cheap and abundant catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for the development of sustainable energy sources. A novel catalyst which could be a promising candidate for such electrocatalysts is described. Co0.85Se supported on three-dimensional hierarchical porous graphene-like carbon (HPG) exhibits outstanding catalytic performances for OER in alkaline medium. It is found that the onset overpotential is 311 mV on the Co0.85Se/HPG electrode, which is more 28 and 41 mV negative than that on the Co/HPG and Co3O4/HPG electrodes. What's more, the value of Tafel slope is 61.7 mV dec(-1) and the overpotential at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is 385 mV on this electrode. The Co0.85Se/HPG of this work is an appealing electrocatalyst for OER in basic electrolyte. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this work p-toluenesulfonic acid (p-TSA) doped highly conductive ternary graphene @polyaniline-TiO2 (GN@Pani-TiO2) was synthesized chemically. The conducting polymers incorporated with metal oxide have good electrical conductivity and large pseudo capacitance which have been utilized as a potential electrode material for biofuel cell electrode preparation. The redox mediator ferritin (Frt) and enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx) was immobilized successfully. The oxidation of glucose by the prepared bioanode was increased with the increase in glucose concentration in the range of 4-24 mM. The electrochemical performance of the bioanode was satisfactory at 20 mM glucose in a phosphate buffer solution (PBS) of pH 7.0 analyzed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 20 mM of glucose at different scan rates (20-100 mVs(-1)), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and chronoamperometry. A saturation current density of 6.77 +/- 0.2 mAcm(-2) was achieved at a 100 mVs(-1) scan rate for 20 mM of glucose oxidation. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A three-dimensional and porous bi-nanospheres electrocatalytic system constructed by in situ generation of Ru nanoclusters inside and outside polydopamine nanoparticles for highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Catalytic systems based on nanospheres usually show satisfied catalytic activities due to their huge specific surface areas for active sites immobilization. However, their catalytic activities are usually restricted by the absence of active sites inside the nanospheres and the inadequate communications between the interior and exterior of the nanospheres. Therefore, it can be anticipated that great improvement will be achieved if a porous three-dimensional catalytic system can be designed, through which the activity sites can be distribute interior and exterior. Herein, polydopamine (PDA) NPs with uniform sizes of 300 nm are prepared. Then, the Ru nanoclusters (Ru NCs) are uniformly generated inside and on the surface of the PDA NPs to afford the bi-nanospheres (Ru-PDA NPs). After annealing, the porous carbonized Ru-PDA NPs (Ru-cPDA-750 NPs) with electroactive nitrogen atoms are finally obtained, exhibiting small overpotential (42 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2)), low value of Tafel slope (35 mV decade(-1)) and robust stability for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which are comparable to that of Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, the study on the effect of Ru NCs amount on electrocatalytic ability reveals that RucPDA NPs loaded with 0.08 wt% of Ru NCs exhibit the best HER catalytic performance compared with the Ru-cPDA NPs loaded with other amount of Ru NCs (0.04-0.16 wt%).

TI  - Non-covalent functionalization of graphene with poly(diallyl dimethylammonium) chloride: Effect of a non-ionic surfactant
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon based nanomaterials (carbon nanotubes, graphene etc) containing various hetero atoms are promising metal free catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction in fuel cells. We report the non-covalent functionalization of graphene with poly(diallyl dimethylammonium) chloride (PDDA), a polyelectrolyte containing nitrogen, using a very simple method. The addition of a non-ionic surfactant (Triton X-100) during functionalization has been observed to improve the interactions between graphene and PDDA. An up-shift in the position of G-peak in the Raman spectra, down-shift in the binding energy (B.E.) of N1s peak and an up-shift in the B.E. of C1s peak in XPS spectra have been observed due to an intermolecular charge-transfer from carbon in graphene to nitrogen in PDDA, which get enhanced in the presence of Triton X-100. Graphene functionalized with PDDA also show good thermal stability. The addition of a non-ionic surfactant enhances the non-covalent functionalization of graphene with PDDA, which is desirable from applications point of view.

TI  - Crystalline polymer functionalized non-oxidized graphene flakes for high gas barrier composites
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - High gas barrier polyethylene (PE) composites containing non-oxidized graphene flakes (GFs) were fabricated through solution blending. GEs were synthesized through ultrasonic-assisted electrochemical exfoliation of graphite. Then, GEs were functionalized via directly inducing PE molecular crystallization along their surface under proper temperature and PE/GEs ratio. The composites with only 0.5 wt% GEs gave a helium leak rate of 6.29 x 10(-8) Pa m(3)/s at 0.6 MPa, outperforming pure PE with a decrease of 83.4%. In addition, the interface interaction between PE and GEs is very weak, and the cohesive energy is only 0.1448 J m(-2). Therefore, at high GEs concentrations (>0.5 wt%), the continuous weak interfaces between the GEs interconnected networks and PE will reduce the effective diffusion path to a certain extent, leading to the reduction of gas barrier efficiency. In general, this method offers great promise for barrier materials that can be utilized in lightweight high-pressure gas storage vessels. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB  - A one-step and fast microwave technique was developed to synthesize graphene-supported TiN nanoparticles (TiN-G) directly from graphene and dihydroxybis (ammonium lactato) titanium (IV). During the synthesis graphene served as a reductant and template to reduce the Ti-precursor into TiN and then uniformly disperse TiN nanoparticles on it. Pt/TiN-G catalyst was also successfully prepared with the portion of Pt nanoparticles was anchored at the interface of TiN and graphene. Electrochemical measurements showed that the Pt/TiN-G catalyst exhibited improved catalytic activity for methanol oxidation and enhanced CO tolerance than those of Pt/G catalyst, attributed to the formation of OH groups on the surface of TiN. And the -OH attached TiN assisted the conversion of CO into CO2. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Highly filled graphite/graphene/carbon nanotube in polybenzoxazine composites for bipolar plate in PEMFC
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This research aims to develop polybenzoxazine (PBA) based composites suitable for bipolar plates in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). PBA composites filled with carbon derivatives i.e. graphite, graphene, and multiwall carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were prepared. The effects of CNT contents from 0-2 wt% at an expense of graphite with constant content of graphene and benzoxazine on properties of the obtained composites were investigated. It was found that the composite with 2 wt% of CNTs exhibited through-plane thermal conductivity as high as 21.3 W/mK which is 44 times higher than that of the composite without CNTs. Also, this composite showed electrical conductivity of 364 S/cm, Flexural Strength of 41.5 MPa and Modulus 49.7 GPa, respectively. These values meet the requirements suggested by the Department of Energy, USA and confirm that these composites are great candidates as bipolar plates for PEMFCs.

TI  - 3D SnO2/sulfonated graphene composites with interpenetrating porous structure as anode material for lithium-ion batteries
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Combine SnO2 nanoparticles with some conductive carbonaceous materials has been regarded as one of the most effective strategies to solve the problems of poor conductivity and volume change. In this work, a SnO2/sulfonated graphene composite with 3D interpenetrating porous structure (3D SnO2/SG) was synthesized. The elaborate designed 3D SG structure not only generates an excellent electronic conductivity, but also buffers the volume expansion of the SnO2 particles. As a result, the desirable 3D possesses enhanced performance when used as anode material in lithium battery. For example, the electro-chemical results showed that the 3D SnO2/SG presents a high reversible specific capacity (928.5 mA h g(-1) at the current density of 200 mA g(-1). Even after 120 cycles, the specific capacity of 679.7 mA h g(-1) (at the current density of 400 mA g(-1)) are still maintained. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - LiFePO4/graphene (LiFePO4/G) cathode material was prepared by a facile ultrasound assisted high temperature ball milling method. Ultrasound assisted was found to be effective to promote the dispersing of the precursor in solution. Physical and electrochemical properties of LiFePO4/G were studied. The results exhibited that graphene combined with the LiFePO4 clusters giving rise to a conductive network. LiFePO4/G displayed a well-crystallized LiFePO4 structure and excellent electrochemical performance. The initial discharge capacities of LiFePO4/G were 162.8, 156.8, 151.9, 145.8, 137.5 and 121.6 mAhg(-1) at rates of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 and 10 C, respectively. Moreover, at 0.1 C-rate, the capacity was 160.4 mAhg(-1) over 100 cycles with a capacity retention of 98.5%. It is concluded that graphene is a conductive additive which can enhance the electrochemical properties of LiFePO4. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Enhanced hydrogen storage performances of LiBH4 modified with three-dimensional porous fluorinated graphene
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Novel fluorinated graphene (FG) nano-sheets with three-dimensional (3D) porous structure were synthesized by one-pot hydrothermal reaction, and then ball milled with LiBH4 to prepare the hydrogen storage composite material. The LiBH4 with 20 wt.% FG composite begins to release hydrogen at 204 degrees C, 120 degrees C lower than that of pure LiBH4. Moreover, it can release 3.45 wt.% hydrogen at 400 degrees C within 1000 s, which is 2.57 times faster than pure LiBH4. The reversibility of the LiBH4-FG composite also has been enhanced, its absorption capacity still reaches 78.6% of initial hydrogen uptake at the 4th cycle. According to the phase composition analyses, F- can partially substitute the anionic H in LiBH4 or LiH, resulting in a favorable thermodynamic modification. Additionally, the activation energy (Ea) of hydrogen desorption of LiBH4 is reduced from 181.80 kJ/mol to 130.87 kJ/mol. The remarkably improved hydrogen storage performances of LiBH4 are largely attributed to the combined effects of the nano-modifying and the function of F anion of the FG.

TI  - Thermal treated 3D graphene as a highly efficient metal-free electrocatalyst toward oxygen reduction reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal treated 3D graphene materials are developed as a highly efficient metal-free electrocatalyst toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Electrochemical analysis reveals that the as-prepared sample shows comparable catalytic activity, better tolerance to methanol crossover effect as well as higher stability than those of commercial Pt/C. For the first time, we find that C=O bonds on 3D graphene display a vital role in catalytic kinetics toward ORR, of which the C=O bonds might influence the adsorption type between oxygen molecule and catalytic active sites on graphene surface. Meanwhile, the unique porous structure of 3D graphene materials are able to trap oxygen molecules, contributing to decrease in diffusion resistance while enhance electrolyte-electrode accessibility for fast mass transport. This work offers a highly efficient metal-free ORR catalyst obtained by a universal approach, and the prepared 3D graphene materials could be further utilized in other energy conversion/storage fields.

TI  - Enhanced electrocatalytic performance of NiOx@MnOx@graphene for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Oxygen electrodes for oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction were intensively investigated due to high overpotential required to drive the four-electron process. A NiOx@MnOx@G nanostructure supported homogenously on graphene nano sheets through an easy and scalable self-assembly method was studied. The NiOx@MnOx@G exhibited a nanostructured NiO nanocrystalline with size around 2.3 nm and an amorphous MnO with controllable thickness. The 25% NiOx@MnOx@G showed remarkable activity for oxygen reduction reaction with a 4-electron process, the half-wave potential was 50 mV, but the stability of 25% NiOx@MnOx G was better than Pt/C-JM. NiOx@Mn0x0G nanostructure exhibited significantly better activity for oxygen evolution reaction compared with MnO,,, which can demonstrate that NiOx could tune the activity of surface amorphous MnOx and dramatically increased oxygen evolution reaction activity. NiOx@MnOx@G is demonstrated with superior oxygen catalysts performance for reversible oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reaction, due to the synergistic effect of NiOx and amorphous MnOx.

CP  - 16th International Symposium on Metal-Hydrogen Systems (MH)
CL  - Guangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - In present study nanocomposites of Graphene Like Material (GLM) and nickel containing 5-60 wt % Ni were prepared by a co-reduction of graphite oxide and Ni2+ ions. These nanocomposites served as effective catalysts of hydrogenation-dehydrogenation of magnesium based materials and showed a high stability on cycling. Composites of magnesium hydride with Ni/GLM were prepared by high-energy ball milling in hydrogen. The microstructures and phase compositions of the studied materials were characterized by XRD, SEM and TEM showing that Ni nanoparticles have size of 2-5 nm and are uniformly distributed in the composites. The kinetic curves of hydrogen absorption and desorption by the composites were measured using a Sievert's type laboratory setup and were analyzed using the Avraami - Erofeev approach. The re-hydrogenation rate constants and the Avraami exponents fitting the kinetic equations for the Mg/MgH2+Ni/GLM composites show significant changes as compared to the Mg/MgH2 prepared at the same conditions and this difference has been assigned to the changes in the mechanism of nucleation and growth and alteration of the rate-limiting steps of the hydrogenation reaction. The composites of Mg with Ni/GLM have a high reversible hydrogen capacity exceeding 6.5 wt % H and also show high rates of hydrogen absorption and desorption and thus belong to the promising hydrogen storage materials.

TI  - Hybrid amorphous MoSx-graphene protected Cu2O photocathode for better performance in H-2 evolution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper reports on a new strategy using a combination of graphene protective layer and amorphous molybdenum sulfide (MoSx) H-2-evolving catalyst layer to form a hybrid coating layer that enhances both photocatalytic activity and stability of the p-Cu2O photocathode for the solar H-2 generation in water. Graphene sheet was transferred from a copper substrate onto the p-Cu2O electrode surface by a simple solution process, resulting in the creation of p-Cu2O/Gr. A layer of MoSx was deposited further to generate a hybrid p-Cu2O/Gr/MoSx photocathode. In a pH 7 phosphate buffer electrolyte and under 1 Sun light illumination, at the applied potential of 0 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), the resultant p-Cu2O/Gr and p-Cu2O/Gr/MoSx show 7-fold superior catalytic activity and significant enhancement of the stability compared to a pristine p-Cu2O photocathode. The obtained results demonstrate that the p-Cu2O/Gr and p-Cu2O/Gr/MoSx photocathodes are very promising for photoelectrochemical cell water splitting. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - High capacity conversion anodes in Li-ion batteries: A review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The structures and properties of high capacity conversion electrodes are key factors as these undergo successive lithium insertion and conversion during an electrochemical process in the rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. The invention of alloying, conversion and displacement reactions seem to be crucial for reversible intercalation/de-intercalation of more than one Li during the metal redox oxidation state to achieve the high capacity with the electrode of modern lithium-ion batteries. Therefore, the exploration of new electrode materials is necessary based on the conversion or displacement concept and their potential applications. In addition, most of the electrode materials were selected on the basis of not only capacity, voltage and volume change of bulk, but it is also important to consider point defects, surface and interface properties, nano-size effects and metal mixtures theoretically to meet their requirements of practical applications. In this review, we overview the development of recent conversion electrodes for their better performance experimentally and theoretically with key issues, challenges and future directions in this rapidly developing field.

CP  - 1st International Conference on Hydrogen Energy
CL  - Univ Aveiro, Aveiro, PORTUGAL
AB  - A new hybrid silicon-phthalocyanine phenyl covalently functionalized graphene (SiPc(phenyl)(2)G(2)) was synthesized. The high fluorescence quenching efficiency and enhanced photocurrent suggested a rapid photoinduced energy transfer from SiPc(phenyl) moiety to graphene sheets through the covalent bond. Using the above synthesized hybrid as a photosensitizer, the SiPc(phenyl)(2)G(2) functionalized Pt nanocomposite (SiPc(phenyl)(2)G(2)/Pt) was easily obtained via photodeposition method. The as-prepared SiPc(phenyl)(2)G(2)/Pt showed efficient photocatalytic hydrogen generation from water splitting under both UV vis and visible light irradiation. Interestingly, with the aid of surfactants, the photo catalytic activity and stability of the SiPc(phenyl)(2)G(2)/Pt nanocomposites in the solution were distinctly improved owning to the nanocomposite aggregation prevention. This investigation demonstrates a unique approach to construct stable high photoresponisve organic hybrid composites for solar energy utilization. (C) 2015 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 3rd International Conference on Advanced Energy Materials (AEM)
CL  - Univ Surrey, Guildford, ENGLAND
AB  - A promising electrocatalyst material composed of 2D layered MoS2-WS2 heterostructure hierarchically assembled into a 3D highly interconnected macroporous network of graphene was facilely fabricated. This in-situ synthesis method involves hydrothermal reaction followed by moderate thermal annealing which guarantees the uniform distribution of the MoS2-WS2 heterojunctions within graphene matrix. The presence of 3D conductive and porous graphene network and the combined merits of MoS2 and WS2 endow the resulting 3D MoS2-WS2/graphene nanohybrids with unique conductivity pathways and channels for electrons and with outstanding electrocatalytic performance towards enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This 3D nanohybrid delivered the small overpotential of 110 mV, and the small Tafel slope of 41 mV per dec, demonstrating high HER activity. Furthermore, the resulting nanohybrids exhibit excellent stability as very trivial drop in the current density was noticed even after 2000 cycles. The superior electrocatalytic performance of 3D MoS2-WS2/graphene over other non-precious metal electrocatalysts is accredited to the robust synergism of 2D MoS2-WS2 with 3D graphene that offer ample active sites and improved conductivity for HER. The proposed approach can be further extended to modify other layered transition metal dichalcogenides with hierarchical 3D porous structure as a competent electrocatalysts for HER.

TI  - Recent approaches to improve Nafion performance for fuel cell applications: A review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Among various polymeric materials applied as polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) for fuel cells, Nafion is known as a standard polymer so that any new material needs to be compared with it. However, low proton conductivity under anhydrous conditions at elevated temperatures due to water evaporation and consequent need for water management, and its low tolerance for fuel impurities still remain as Nafion's major shortcomings. Development of new PEM with higher conductivity at high temperatures and stability for application at anhydrous conditions is highly desired. The aim of this review is thus to specify the latest achievements made to improve the Nafion performance by means of pretreatments, incorporation of reinforcing agents, nanocomposites, blending, ionic liquids, and so on. In recent years, a significant enhancement in Nafion performance, at humidified conditions, has been reported and many efforts have been conducted to improve its performance under dried conditions. Although impressive enhancements in Nafion performance have been reported, a need for revolutionary approaches to overcome its drawbacks is undeniably needed for future works.

This work reports CoS1.097 embedded in flower-like biomass derived from red blood cells (RBCs) nanocatalyst, was synthesized via a one-step, hydrothermal method. Compared to pure CoS1.097 microspheres, the generated flower-like CoS1.097-biomass (CoS1.097-B) nanosheets exhibits enhanced OER electrocatalytic activity with a onset potential of 1.43 V (vs. RHE), an overpotential of 260 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and a low Tafel slope of 83 mV dec(-1). Moreover, the CoS1.097-B displays good OER stability with little decrease after 400 cycles.

AB  - Nanocomposite membranes of sulfonated polyether ether ketone (sPEEK) are prepared with polyaminobenzene sulfonic acid grafted single-walled carbon nanotubes copolymer (PABS-SWCNT) and its zwitterion interactions are studied. The nanocomposite membranes are prepared through solution cast technique using PABS-SWCNT as additive in different weight % (0.1, 0.15, and 0.2) ratio. The additive and nanocomposite membranes are characterized for its surface morphology, composition, thermal and physico-chemical properties. The nanocomposite membrane comprising optimized content of PABS-SWCNT (0.15 wt %) shows improved proton conductivity and reduced methanol crossover resulting in enhanced DMFC peak power density of 150 mW cm(-2) in comparison to 110 mW cm(-2) for sPEEK and 80 mW cm(-2) for Nafion (R) 117 respectively. The improved durability till 100 h for sPEEK/PABS-SWCNT (0.15 wt %) compared to sPEEK and Nafion-117 confirms its viability in DMFC application. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB  - The sulfonated graphene nanosheet-supported platinum (s-Pt/GNS) catalyst synthesized via a simple thermal-treatment in the presence of concentrated sulfuric acid was reported in this study. Influence of sulfonation on its structural, surface, morphological and catalytic characteristics of as-prepared s-Pt/GNS was explored using X-ray diffractometer, Raman spectrometry, zeta potential analyzer, scanning and transmission electron microscopes, and cyclic voltammetry. For the oxygen reduction reaction, the current density generated from the s-Pt/GNS at 0.6 V was approximately 32.5 A g(-1) Pt, which was about 193% higher than that of original Pt/GNS.

TI  - Molybdenum/graphene - Based catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction synthesized by a rapid photothermal method
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Catalysis of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is important in the development of an energy economy based on clean hydrogen gas. In this work, we report a new catalyst material for the generation of hydrogen via hydronium reduction. The new material, which consists of MoO2, sulfur, and graphene, was prepared by co-reduction of molybdenum salt and graphite oxide in air in the presence of focused solar radiation. The potential utility of this material for HER catalysis was evaluated by cyclic and linear-sweep voltammograms and compared against a Pt/C commercial catalyst. The MoO2/graphene hybrid nanocomposite exhibits a Tafel slope of 47 mV/dec and hydrogen evolution at a potential only similar to 120 mV more negative than the standard Pt/Carbon catalyst at 10 mA/cm(2) current density. The hydrogen gas generated by the catalytic material was measured using gas chromatography. The simple synthesis and low overpotential suggests that this hybrid composite has potential as an HER catalyst. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, the close-packed structure and hydrophobicity of the graphene sheets will prevent noble metal nanoparticles (NMNPs) from exposed to the electrolyte, leading to a reduction in the utilization of NMNPs. In this work, a unique 3D graphene/PtNPs composite catalyst with double network channels is in-situ fabricated. The superficial rGO sheets of PS/rGO@PtNPs composite particles are interconnected to form 3D network structure due to the supporting of the PS microspheres. The 3D structure not only provides interconnected channel for diffusion of the electrolyte into the composite catalysts, but also forms an ideal graphene network to increase the connectivity and conductivity of the composite catalysts. Compared with the close-packed rGO/PtNPs catalyst, the PS/rGO@PtNPs composites with 3D network structure have higher catalytic activity, reaches up to 586.96 mA/mg for methanol oxidation reaction.

TI  - A novel ultraefficient non-noble metal composite cocatalyst Mo2N/Mo2C/graphene for enhanced photocatalytic H-2 evolution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-noble metal cocatalyst is a hot research issue in photocatalytic H-2 production due to its low cost and potential substitution of the usually used expensive noble metal cocatalyst. Here, we reported a new non-noble metal cocatalyst Mo2N/Mo2C/graphene (GR) for ultraefficiently enhanced photocatalytic H-2 production of CdS under visible light irradiation. The optimum composite 2.0 wt % Mo2N/Mo2C/GR/CdS achieves an ultrahigh H-2 evolution rate of 4520 mu mol/h/g, which is 18 times higher than that of CdS alone and 3.6 times higher than the optimum 1.0 wt % Pt/CdS. The XRD shifts and HRTEM demonstrates the special structure (heterojunction) between the interfaces of Mo2N and Mo2C, which mainly accounts for the ultraefficience of Mo2N/Mo2C/GR. This study firstly presents a novel ultraefficient non-noble metal cocatalyst Mo2N/Mo2C/GR and reveals the interface effects among the compositions of the cocatalyst.

TI  - Synthesis of engineered graphene nanocomposites coated with NiCo metal-organic frameworks as electrodes for high-quality supercapacitor
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Metal-organic frameworks (MOF) are a novel generation of promising electrodes for supercapacitors. The synthesis of glucose modified, high-quality graphene (HQG) as a platform for the nucleation and growth of bimetallic MOF nanosheets (NiCo-MOF) is reported. The -COOH and -OH groups formed on the surface, thus enhance the interaction between the HQG and NiCo-MOF. This heterostructure is used as an electrode in the preparation of asymmetric supercapacitors with a capacity of 244 F/g and an energy density of 76.3 W h/g. The nanocomposite also exhibits a high specific capacitance of 4077.3 F/g at a current density of 2.5 A/g. Therefore, new approaches have been introduced for the fabrication of efficient supercapacitors, and a step forward has been taken for the development of other electrical applications, including batteries, fuel cells, catalysts, and types of sensors.

AB  - Pulse current electrodeposition (PCE) technique was used to prepare graphene-supported platinum nanoparticles (GN-PtNPs) electrodes for the methanol electro-oxidation reaction in acidic media. The influences of the PCE parameters (applied current density, concentration of the Pt precursor, and duty cycle) upon the as-prepared GN-PtNPs electrodes for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in terms of catalytic activity and tolerance against poisoning were studied using the Taguchi design of experiment (DOE). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) and signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio analysis provided prediction of optimal electrodeposition conditions to yield GN-PtNPs electrode which give the best MOR performance. The values of confirmatory experiment were demonstrated close to the values predicted using the Taguchi method. Transmission electron microscopy images showed that the Pt crystallites in flower-like structure were deposited evenly on the surface of graphene sheet. The Pt crystallites were predominantly in a zero-valent, metallic Pt state based on the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Graphene nanosheet@spherical ordered mesoporous carbon/sulfur nanocomposites as cathode material for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Owing to the high energy density and rich resource, Li-S batteries are now considered as a promising direction in energy storage. Nevertheless, the electrochemical properties of sulfur host materials have been limited by the large volume changes during cycles, the dissolution of polysulfides in an electrolyte, and the insulating properties of lithium polysulfides. Based on the above conclusions, a novel cathode material of graphene nanosheet@spherical ordered mesoporous carbon/sulfur nanocomposite (GNs@s-OMC/S) where s-OMC/S was wrapped by GNs has been synthesized in this article and delivers superior cycle stability. According to the tests, GNs@s-OMC/S provides a capacity of 1159 mAh g(-1) at a 0.4 C discharge rate. In addition, even at a high rate of 4 C, the discharge capacity of GNs@s-OMC/S can also remain 767 mAh g(-1), representing a fantastic rate performance and high specific capacity. It can be ensured that the narrow channels provided by s-OMC and the graphene entrapment with high conductivity enhance the electrochemical performance of the cathode.

TI  - A first-principles study of Sc-decorated graphene with pyridinic-N defects for hydrogen storage
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introducing impurity atoms and vacancy prevents transition metal atoms from aggregating on carbon-based nanomaterials, which makes the TM decoration a realistic and effective way to improve the hydrogen storage capacity. By performing the first-principles calculation, we studied the adsorption of hydrogen molecules on Sc-decorated graphene with single-vacancy defect (SV) and pyridinic-N defects: SV + 1N, SV + 2N, SV + 3N and DV + 4N. Our calculations show that Sc atoms will be uniformly dispersed on these defective graphene with the binding energies higher than the cohesive energy of bulk Sc. We find that the binding energy of Sc and the adsorption energy of H-2 molecules on these defective structures both change gradually as the variation of N concentration. The Sc-decorated SV + 3N is the most promising material for hydrogen storage, in which each Sc atom could store 5H(2) with the adsorption energies in the range of 0.2-0.4 eV. Moreover, our calculations show that the double-sided Sc-decorated graphene with pyridinic-N defects can adsorb more H-2 molecules with higher adsorption energies. It indicates that the double-sided adsorptions are more favorable for hydrogen storage with high capacity. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - CoFe2O4@methyl cellulose core-shell nanostructure and their hybrids with functionalized graphene aerogel for high performance asymmetric supercapacitor
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, the use of asymmetric supercapacitors (ASC) has attracted much attention due to their optimum storage of energy and a high range of voltage. Here, we have indicated the design and fabrication of a unique ASC based on metal-spinel core-shell nanocomposite (CoFe2O4@MC) as a positive electrode and a p-phenylenediamine (PPDA)-graphene aerogel composite (AP) as a negative electrode in aqueous KOH electrolyte solution. The CoFe2O4@MC nanocomposite was prepared by the chemical deposition method. The AP was also effortlessly organized using the hydrothermal method. Considering the incorporation of methylcellulose carbohydrate polymer (MC) into the CoFe2O4 nanomaterial and consequently having a porous structure, a specific capacitance of 433.3 F g(-1) was obtained at the current density of 1 A g(-1) with the configuration of three electrodes. The CoFe2O4@MC//AP-ASC operates in the voltage range up to 2.3 V and provides a specific capacitance of 99 in 1 A g(-1). It presents an impressive energy density and power density of similar to 3 W h Kg(-1) and 1056 W kg(-1), respectively which prove its quality. The most important feature seems to be good cycling stability and capacity retention of 89% after 2000 cycles. These splendid outcomes show that CoFe2O4@MC nanocomposite possibly seems to be a satisfying choice for the next generation of devices with the capability of energy storage.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Transition metal oxyhydroxides have been used as promising electrocatalysts for water splitting however, their catalytic activity is restricted due to low surface area and poor conductivity. Herein, we report novel composite FeOOH@ZIF-12/graphene composite as electrocatalyst for water oxidation, whereby ZIF-12 provide extra surface for the FeOOH dispersion whilst graphene act as excellent electron mediator. The composite shows a low overpotential value of 291 mV to attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope value of 78 mV dec(-1). The catalyst offers a maximum current density of 101 mA cm(-2), while it gives a turnover frequency (TOF) value of 0.031 s(-1) at an over potential of 291 mV only. The excellent activity and remarkable stability of composite is attributed to highly conductive and porous support. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Sandwiched graphene-fullerene composite: A novel 3-D nanostructured material for hydrogen storage
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this paper is to investigate hydrogen storage capacity of a novel carbon based nanoporous material composition that is built up by covalently sandwiched fullerene units between parallel graphene sheets. Owing to its micro and meso porous morphology, the recently proposed sandwich-structured material has high surface/weight ratios and superior structural stability. The three-dimensional atomistic models of the sandwiched nanocomposite structures are generated by covalently fusing fullerene units randomly dispersed between the graphene layers which are stacked on each other in a layerwise manner by applying the heat welding method via molecular dynamic simulations. Hydrogen adsorption properties of sandwiched structures are investigated using grand canonical Monte Carlo calculations. Different fullerene types (i.e. C-180, C-320 and C-540) are considered in simulations as sandwich core. The effects of lithium doping on the hydrogen storage performance of the proposed structures are also investigated in simulations. The simulation results show that a lithium-doped sandwiched structure with doping ratio of Li:C = 1:8 can overpass the gravimetric capacity of 5% while an undoped structure can reach the value of 3.83% at 77 K and 1 bar, which underlines the significant hydrogen storage potential of the proposed nanostructured material.

TI  - Investigation of the role of Cu2O beads over the wrinkled graphene as an anode material for lithium ion battery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Herein, we report a controlled two-step synthesis technique to prepare Cu2O nanobeads over hydrogen exfoliated graphene (Cu2O NBs-HEG) and its application as an anode material in lithium ion battery. SEM images have proven, how the long copper hydroxide chains are cut shortened and ended up in copper oxide beads. The Cu2O beads are acting as a spacer in between the two dimensional planes and increasing the specific capacity of the battery almost three fold of the theoretical capacity of Cu2O. The oxidation states of copper are confirmed through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Because of the synergetic effect of copper oxide and wrinkled graphene, the initial discharge capacity of the battery got enhanced to 2050 mAh/g. In order to get the charge transfer resistance of the electrode, the impedance spectroscopy is carried out and the results have been discussed. Copyright (C) 2016, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

TI  - Robust three dimensional N-doped graphene supported Pd nanocomposite as efficient electrocatalyst for methanol oxidation in alkaline medium
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Pd nanoparticles (PdNPs) with the diameter of similar to 3.2 nm were successfully confined within a robust three dimensional (3D) N-doped porous graphene (R3DNG) via a polyol-assisted reduction strategy. The as-obtained PdNPs/R3DNG composite was characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD and XPS, and was conducted as electrocatalyst for methanol oxidation in alkaline medium. The results showed that PdNPs/R3DNG featured the remarkable electrocatalytic activity (2.71 A mg(-1) Pd) and outstanding cyclic stability (66.5% forward peak current retention after 1000 cycles), which is even superior to the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst. The synergistic effect between the support of R3DNG and PdNPs is believed to be responsible for the outstanding electrocatalytic performance. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - MoS2-graphene-CuNi2S4 nanocomposite an efficient electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a facile methodology for the synthesis of a novel 2D-MoS2, graphene and CuNi2S4 (MoS2-g-CuNi2S4) nanocomposite that displays highly efficient electrocatalytic activity towards the production of hydrogen. The intrinsic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of MoS2 nanosheets was significantly enhanced by increasing the affinity of the active edge sites towards H+ adsorption using transition metal (Cu and Ni-2) dopants, whilst also increasing the edge sites exposure by anchoring them to a graphene framework. Detailed XPS analysis reveals a higher percentage of surface exposed S at 17.04%, of which 48.83% is metal bonded S (sulfide). The resultant MoS2-g-CuNi2S4 nanocomposites are immobilized upon screen-printed electrodes (SPEs) and exhibit a HER onset potential and Tafel slope value of - 0.05 V (vs. RHE) and 29.3 mV dec(-1), respectively. These values are close to that of the polycrystalline Pt electrode (near zero potential (vs. RHE) and 21.0 mV dec(-1), respectively) and enhanced over a bare/unmodified SPE (- 0.43 V (vs. RHE) and 149.1 mV dec(-1), respectively). Given the efficient, HER activity displayed by the novel MoS2-g-CuNi2S4/SPE electrochemical platform and the comparatively low associated cost of production for this nanocomposite, it has potential to be a cost-effective alternative to Pt within electrolyser technologies.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploiting photocatalysts with environmental friendliness, noble-metal-free and high efficiency is a great challenge for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. In this work, we synthesized a novel MoS2/rGO/Cd0.6Zn0.4S composite catalyst based on microsphere-structural polymer with highly efficient photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation. The 5.0%MoS2/rGO/Cd0.6Zn0.4S exhibited the highest H-2 evolution rate of 11.7 mmol/h/g, which about 2.1 times higher than that without MoS2 and 4 times higher than that without PSGM. This superior photocatalytic activity, further demonstrated by the transient photocurrent responses and electrochemical impedance spectrum, was attributed to the effective separation of the photo-generated charge carriers promoted by the positive synergetic effect between the MoS2 and graphene. This study provided a promising approach to achieve high-efficiency H-2 evolution based on graphene and MoS2 without noble metals. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - P-doped 3D graphene network supporting uniformly vertical MoS2 nanosheets for enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to optimize the conductivity of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and promote its large-scale application as a catalyst for hydrogen evolution, MoS2 is usually used to form composites with conductive materials, but these hybrid materials suffer from scare active sites, overlapping and complicate process. In this work, phosphoric acid is used as a builder of stereoscopic structures, which can not only twist graphene sheets into a P-doped three-dimensional (3D) graphene network but also promote surface electron transport between graphene sheets. Without adding additional framework materials such as carbon nano tubes or nickel foam, stereoscopic MoS2/graphene structures are formed with a large number of twisted graphene sheets to support the vertical growth of MoS2 and expose the edge sites of MoS2, showing a low Tafel slope about 35 mV dec(-1), a high current density of 900 mA cm(-2) at about 300 mV and a robust stability over 2000 cycles. Thus, this work shows a possibility to synthesize an efficient catalyst on a large-scale for hydrogen evolution reaction, which can promote the realization of hydrogen economy.

TI  - Improvement in the hydrogenation-dehydrogenation performance of a Mg-Al alloy by graphene supported Ni
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mg-based materials are very promising candidates for hydrogen storage. In this paper, the graphene supported Ni was introduced to the Mg90Al10 system by hydrogenation synthesis (HS) and mechanical milling (MM). The 80 wt%Ni@Gn catalyst was synthesized by a facile chemical reduction method. The microstructures of the catalyst and composite show that Ni nanoparticles are well supported on the surface of graphene and they are dispersed uniformly on the surface of MgH2 particles. After heating to 450 degrees C and holding at 340 degrees C for 2 h subsequently under 2.0 MPa hydrogen pressure, all the samples are almost completely hydrogenated. According to the temperature programmed desorption test, the Mg90Al10-8(80 wt%Ni@Gn) composite could desorb 5.85 wt% H-2 which comes up to 96% of the theoretical hydrogen storage capacity. Moreover, it shows the optimal hydriding/dehydriding performance, absorbing 5.11 wt% hydrogen within 400 s at 523 K, and desorbing 5.81 wt% hydrogen within 1800 s at 573 K.

AB  - A simple one-pot methodology is developed for the synthesis of nitrogen doped graphene via supercritical fluid (SCF) processing using glycine as a nitrogen precursor. The presence of various N-containing functional groups was determined by FT-IR and the amount of N-doping in the graphene was found to be 4.5 wt% using the elemental analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The electrochemical capacitance measurements are performed using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The nitrogen doped graphene exhibited enhanced capacitive performance with a maximum specific capacitance of 270 F/g at 0.5 A/g current density with high specific capacitance retention of 90% over 10,000 cycles at 10 A/g current density. The fabricated symmetric supercapacitor cell showed a high energy density of 4.1 and 36 Wh/kg in aqueous and ionic liquid electrolyte, respectively. The high energy density obtained in ionic liquid is promising for their potential application in electrochemical energy system. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Spinel NiCo2O4 3-D nanoflowers supported on graphene nanosheets as efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts with non-noble metals are very critical for the large-scale exploitation of electrocatalytic hydrogen production systems. To improve the catalytic activity of OER electrocatalysts, several design strategies, such as construction of nanostructures, porous structures and composite materials have been proposed. Herein, spinel NiCo2O4 3-D nanoflowers supported on graphene nanosheets (GNs) are prepared by a simple solvothermal synthesis method as non-noble metal electrocatalysts for OER. The present NiCo2O4/GNs composite integrates multiple advantages of nanostructures, porous structures and composite materials, including high surface area, abundant catalytic sites and high stability. Benefiting from the favorable features, the NiCo2O4/GNs composite exhibits a better OER performance than NiCo2O4 and RuO2 in alkaline medium, which has a low onset potential (1.50 V), a small Tafel slope (137 mV dec(-1)). The present work opens a new window for the construction of the carbon-supported 3-D nanostructure of transition metal catalysts with optimizable electrocatalytic performances for electrocatalytic hydrogen production.

TI  - Thermodynamically controlled Pt deposition over graphene nanoplatelets: Effect of Pt loading on PEM fuel cell performance
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Graphene is considered as a promising catalyst support for polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells because of its excellent properties. Recent studies showed that electrocatalytic activity, fuel cell performance, catalyst utilization efficiency and long term durability can be improved by using graphene as the catalyst support. In here, we report the synthesis of graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) supported platinum catalysts using supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO(2)) deposition technique. The prepared catalysts were characterized in terms of their structure, morphology and thermal behavior by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The electrocatalytic and half-cell performances of the as-prepared catalysts were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and PEM fuel cell performance testing. Small size and well distribution of Pt nanoparticles on GNPs surfaces were achieved by using scCO(2) deposition which improves the PEM fuel cell performance. To the best of our knowledge decoration of Pt nanoparticles on GNPs via scCO(2) deposition and their detailed fuel cell performances were presented for the first time in the literature.

TI  - Zn-doped hematite modified by graphene-like WS2: A p-type semiconductor hybrid photocathode for water splitting to produce hydrogen
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A p-type Zn-doped hematite (alpha-Fe2O3(Zn)) in spindle-shape with an acceptor density of ca. 4.21 x 10(18) cm(-3) were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method. After alpha-Fe2O3(Zn) was modified with graphene-like WS2 (alpha-Fe2O3(Zn)/WS2), the photoelectrochemical performances of the composite can be further enhanced. A photocell composed of the p-type alpha-Fe2O3(Zn)/WS2 nanocomposite as photocathode and n-type alpha-Fe2O3 as photoanode was assembled to estimate the photocatalytic activity of alpha-Fe2O3(Zn)/WS2. The amount of the hydrogen and oxygen produced from this tandem cell with the optimal electrodes under 2 h simulated solar light irradiation is 12.5 mu mol and 4.3 mu mol, respectively.

TI  - Facile synthesis of metal oxide nanofibers and construction of continuous proton-conducting pathways in SPEEK composite membranes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a facile approach was used to prepare hydrophilic TiO2 nanofibers (TiNFs) by calcining electrospun polyacrylonitrile nanofibers embedded with titanium precursors. A high-performance proton exchange membrane (PEM) was achieved by incorporating the TiNFs into a sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) matrix. The high aspect ratios of the inorganic nanofibers permitted interconnecting of ion-conducting channels, thereby significantly improving proton conductivity in the membrane. In addition, the TiNFs provided tortuous pathways for methanol transport, suppressing the methanol permeability coefficient. The maximum power density of the SPEEK/TiNFs-1.0 composite membrane was 1.4 times higher than that of the pristine SPEEK membrane at 100% relative humidity and 60 degrees C. Furthermore, the stable fiber skeleton improved the mechanical stability of the composite membrane. The SPEEK/TiNFs-1.0 membrane exhibited superior mechanical properties with the tensile strength of 40.4 MPa and maximum elongation at break of 76%. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Nanosized manganese oxide supported on carbon black: A new, cheap and green composite for water oxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Water splitting is a very promising method to produce hydrogen. However, water oxidation is a crucial step for hydrogen production since it can provide cheap electrons for proton reduction. Herein a nanosized Mn oxide immobilized on carbon black as a reasonable catalyst for water oxidation is reported. The composites were synthesized by a simple, lowcost procedure using different ratios of carbon black and Mn oxide. Catalysts were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDX), scanning electron microscope (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), electronic spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). In the next step, the water-oxidizing activities of the composites were observed in the presence of cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate. The composites were reasonable catalysts with turnover frequencies of similar to 0.07 (mmol O-2/mol Mn s). In addition to the water-oxidizing activity, the self-healing for this composite in the experimental condition was also studied. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Studies on new highly phosphonated poly (ether ether ketone) based promising proton conducting membranes for high temperature fuel cell
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study deals with the development of poly ether ether ketone (PEEK) based proton exchange membrane (PEM) having phosphonic acid as protogenic moiety. The synthesis of phosphonated PEEK was carried out in two simpler steps i.e. chloromethylation followed by phosphonation through Michaelis-Arbuzov reaction. The product was further investigated for structural property through FTIR, H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, P-31 NMR and XRD while thermal properties were analysed by TGA. Other physical properties such as ion exchange capacity, water uptake and proton conductivity were determined for the prepared membranes to execute their suitability as PEM. The presence of phosphonic acid group provides good thermal and chemical stability to the membranes. The high substitution degree (1.11-1.56) achieved in present case was favourable for providing significant proton conductivity of 0.047 S/cm at 120 degrees C under hydrated conditions to the corresponding membranes which entitle them as potential candidate for PEMs in fuel cells at high temperature.

AB  - ZnWO4, PPy, and PPy/ZnWO4 nanoparticles were prepared using chemical synthesis. The structural, compositional and morphological properties of the prepared samples have been investigated using XRD, FTIR, SEM, and HRTEM respectively. The powder XRD reveals the monoclinic wolframite structure for both ZnWO4 and PPy/ZnWO4 nanocomposite. SEM confirms the wrapping of ZnWO4 with PPy. The electrodes of ZnWO4, PPy, and PPy/ZnWO4 have been tested as bifunctional electrocatalyst towards HER and OER using constant current chronopotentiometry (CP) and Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV). The electrochemical surface area and the electrocatalytic activity PPy/ZnWO4 nanocomposite towards HER and OER are greater than that of pure ZnWO4 and PPy. The Tafel slope of PPy/ZnWO4 nanocomposite is 76 and 84 mV dec(-1) in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH at room temperature for HER and OER respectively. The results suggest that PPy/ZnWO4 nanocomposite is a good candidate for the bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - On account of on the dominant performance of Ni2P, rGO and g-C3N4 itself, with a view to conquer the disadvantages of Ni2P, rGO and g-C3N4 its own, the g-C3N4/rGO/Ni2P is successfully designed and prepared by a simple hydrothermal reaction, which is used in dye sensitized system for high-efficient photocatalytic H-2 evolution. The rGO is adhered to the outside appearance of the g-C3N4 nanosheets and fish-scale shape Ni2P is anchored on the surface of rGO and g-C3N4. The above three forms a synergistic effect. The maximum amount of H-2 evolution reaches about 266 mu mol for 5 h over the g-C3N4/rGO/Ni2P photo-catalyst when the content of rGO is 8%, which is 10.6 times higher than g-C3N4. Synergy between the above three materials is certified by some characterizations and the results of which are consistent with each other. In addition, the possible mechanism of photo-catalytic hydrogen production is proposed. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Herein we show a construction of high-performance supercapacitor electrode made of cerium vanadate uniformly glazed over polypyrrole (CeVO4/Ppy) nanostructures by a simple hydrothermal method, which was characterized by various analytical techniques. Electrochemical studies on CeVO4/Ppy/Ni foam with 1 M KOH show a maximum specific capacitance of 1236 F/g at a current density of 0.75 A/g. These salient features, together with smart interactions between the interconstituents, CeVO4 and Ppy, lead to high conductivity, specific capacitance, and cycling stability with retention of 92.6% capacitance in 10,000 cycles of GCD curves. Additionally, the asymmetric supercapacitor based on activated carbon (AC), AC//CeVO4/Ppy device delivers a high specific capacitance of 116 F/g and energy density of 52.2 Wh/Kg at power density of 675.9 W/kg along with high capacity retention of 77.80% after 10,000 cycles. This system could be scaled up to large-scale production of high power devices, which opens up lot of opportunities in modern electronic industrial applications.

AB  - In this work, ZnCdS nanoparticles (NPs) were decorated with FePt alloy, forming nanocomposites via ethylene glycol reduction method. The photocatalytic H-2 production of the Fe1-xPtx-ZnCdS NPs was studied by changing the composition and weight percentage of Fe1-xPtx alloy in the nanocomposites under visible light (lambda >= 420 nm) irradiation. The results showed that the hydrogen production rate of Fe1-xPtx-ZnCdS NPs had a significant enhancement over the pure ZnCdS (740 mu mol g(-) h(-)). The activity of the nanocomposites was dependent on the composition of Fe1-xPtx alloy and the highest hydrogen production rate of 2265 mu mol g(-) h(-) was achieved by the 0.5 wt% Fe0.3Pt0.7-ZnCdS nanocomposites, which was even better than that of 0.5 wt% Pt-ZnCdS (1626 mu mol g(-) h(-)) under the same condition. This study highlights the significance of Pt base alloys as new cocatalysts for the development of novel composite photocatalysts. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB  - N doped graphenes (NGs) are believed to be promising materials for constructing novel hybrid composites with desirable functionalities and applications in many fields. Therefore, a better understanding of the NGs holds the key to a better performance of the hybrid properties. A facile and low-cost preparation of NGs supported hollow PdCu alloy nanocubes (H-PdCu) catalysts were introduced in this paper. To increase the stability and efficiency of the catalysts, a two-step strategy was employed, which included the preparation of NGs and the synthesis of hollow PdCu alloy nanocube catalysts. A series of NGs using melamine, polypyrrole (ppy) and polyaniline (PANI) as nitrogen source, respectively. The influence of the different N species (pyridinic N, pyrrolic N and graphite N) on the morphologies and corresponding electrical properties of H-PdCu nanoparticles were studied. The results indicate that NGs are successfully synthesized, and hollow PdCu alloy nanocubes are well-dispersed on the surface of them with a relatively narrow particle size distribution. Electrochemical characterizations reveal that the H-PdCu/melamine-NG catalyst has excellent catalytic activity and stability toward alcohols oxidation in alkaline electrolyte, which can serve as promising anode catalysts in direct alcohols fuel cells (DAFCs).

AB  - Nanostructured PtRu and Pt dispersed functionalized graphene-functionalized multi walled carbon nanotubes (PtRu/(f-G-f-MWNT)), (Pt/(f-G-f-MWNT)) nanocomposites have been prepared. Electrochemical studies have been performed for the methanol oxidation using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry technique. Full cell measurements have been performed using PtRu nanoparticles dispersed on the mixture of functionalized graphene (f-G) and functionalized multi walled carbon nanotubes (f-MWNT) in different ratios as anode electrocatalyst for methanol oxidation and Pt/f-MWNT as cathode catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction in direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC). In addition, full cell measurements have been performed with PtRu/(50 wt% f-MWNT + 50 wt% f-G) and Pt/(50 wt%f-MWNT + 50 wt% f-G) as anode and cathode electrocatalyst respectively. With PtRu/(50 wt%f-MWNT + 50 wt% f-G) as anode electrocatalyst, a high power density of about 40 mW/cm(2) has been obtained, in accordance with cyclic voltammetry studies. Further enhancement in the power density of about 68 mW/cm(2) has been observed with PtRu/(50 wt% f-MWNT + 50 wt% f-G) and Pt/(50 wt% f-MWNT + 50 wt% f-G) as electrocatalyst at anode and cathode respectively. These results have been discussed based on the change in the morphology of the f-G sheets due to the addition of f-MWNT. Copyright (C) 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

AB  - In this work, bimetallic PtX (X = Sn, Cu) decorated graphene nanohybrids (PtX/G) were developed, which showed enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance than that of Pt/G in Eosin Y sensitized H-2 production system. The presence of Sn or Cu in PtX/G nanohybrids can remarkably improve the photogenerated charge separation efficiency and contribute to promoting the reduction of protons to molecular hydrogen in comparison to with noble metal Pt. Meanwhile, graphene acted as a more suitable electronic support to accelerate the migration of electrons from sensitizer to catalysts, owing to its higher electron mobility and larger surface area than other supports (such as carbon sphere, Al2O3 and SiO2). The optimal H-2 evolution rate PtSn/G and PtCu/G was about 2.2 and 2.0 times higher than that of Pt/G. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of PtSn/G and PtCu/G reached up to 12.46% and 11.06% under visible light irradiation (lambda >= 420 nm), respectively. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Facile synthesis and catalytic application of selenium doped graphene/CoFe2O4 for highly efficient and noble metal free dehydrogenation of formic acid
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The ongoing search for new noble metal free catalysts with excellent catalytic performance to replace homogeneous catalysts with difficult synthesis, separating and recycling and also expensive heterogeneous catalysts has been viewed as an important strategy to promote the development of hydrogen generation from formic acid. In this study, we reported the facile fabrication of selenium doped graphene/CoFe2O4 hybrid materials which exhibited excellent catalytic activity and magnetic recyclability for dehydrogenation of formic acid. Besides facilitating the catalyst isolation, CoFe2O4 nanoparticles have crucial role on the catalytic activity of the as-obtained material. Our results confirmed that combining CoFe2O4 with graphene is an effective strategy to inhibit metal oxide aggregation and synergistically improve the catalytic activity. Moreover, it is also demonstrated that selenium with large atomic size and high polarizability can enhance the catalytic activity of selenium doped graphene/CoFe2O4 hybrid materials.

TI  - Graphene/Ni-Fe layered double hydroxide nano composites as advanced electrode materials for glucose electro oxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nickel Iron Layered Double Hydroxide nano composites were electrochemically synthesized on graphene/glassy carbon electrode at a constant potential. The surface morphology and the structure of the electrodes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), elemental mapping analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Atomic force microscopy (AFM). This electrode was studied for glucose electro-oxidation reaction using cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. Results confirmed high catalytic activity, stability of the graphene/Ni-Fe LDH electrode and glucose electro oxidation reaction on this electrode is under the effect of diffusion process. Also in comparison of some previous reported methods for the glucose electro oxidation, graphene/Ni Fe LDH shows a high diffusion coefficient as an electro catalyst for glucose electro oxidation. Electrical equivalent circuits for electrodes is obtained by using the Zview software. The low electrochemical charge transfer resistance (R-ct) was obtained on the graphene/Ni Fe LDH due to the presence of Ni-Fe LDH nano composite. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Phosphorus-doped Fe3O4 nanoflowers grown on 3D porous graphene for robust pH-Universal hydrogen evolution reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - It is extremely necessary to develop highly efficient and low-cost non-noble metal electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under a pH-universal condition in the realm of sustainable energy. Herein, we have successfully prepared phosphorus doped Fe3O4 nanoflowers on three-dimensional porous graphene (denoted as P-Fe3O4@3DG) via a simple hydrothermal and low-temperature phosphating reaction. The P-Fe3O4@3DG hybrid composite not only demonstrates superior performance for HER in 1.0 M KOH with low overpotential (123 mV at 10 mA/cm(2)), small Tafel slope (65 mV/dec), and outstanding durability exceeding 50 h, but also exhibits satisfying performances under neutral and acidic medium as well. The 3D graphene foam with large porosity, high conductivity, and robust skeleton conduces to more active sites, and faster electron and ion transportation. The phosphorus dopant provides low Gibbs free energy and ability of binging H+. The synergistic effect of 3DG substrate and P-Fe3O4 active material both accelerates the catalytic activity of Fe-based hybrid composite for HER. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Enhancement of hydrogen desorption in magnesium hydride catalyzed by graphene nanosheets supported Ni-CeOx hybrid nanocatalyst
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A new hybrid nanocatalyst Ni-CeOx/GNS (graphene nanosheets supported nanoscale Ni and CeOx., x = 1.69) of high surface area and porosity is synthesized by impregnation reduction method. It is demonstrated that the Ni-CeOx/GNS nanocatalyst exhibits improved catalytic effect on the dehydrogenation performances of MgH2 compares to individual Ni/GNS, CeOx/GNS, or GNS. Differential scanning calorimetry psq measurement proved that both the onset and peak desorption temperature of MgH2-5 wt% Ni-CeOx/GNS (abbreviated as MgNCG) nanocomposites can be decreased by 90.2 and 60.1 degrees C, respectively. Isothermal desorption kinetic test confirmed that the dehydrogenation kinetics of MgNCG nanocomposites is dozens of times higher than the pure milled MgH2, e.g. MgNCG nano composites can release 6.50 wt% H-2 within 10 min at 300 degrees C with an initial hydrogen pressure of 5 KPa, superior to 0.16 wt% H-2 desorbed by MgH2 under the same condition. Additionally, the activation energy (Ea) of MgNCG decreases significantly contrast with pure milled MgH2, it is proposed that the tri-component of Ni-CeOx/GNS nanocatalyst has a synergistic effect on the highly efficient dehydrogenation of MgH2.

AB  - In this work, the electroreduction of oxygen on nitrogen-doped graphene and multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composite catalysts is investigated. Acid-treated MWCNTs and graphite oxide were doped using biuret, carbohydrazide and semicarbazide hydrochloride as the nitrogen precursors. The reactants were mixed with carbon nanomaterials and pyrolysed in an inert atmosphere at 800 degrees C. Scanning electron microscopy was used to characterise the surface morphology of catalysts and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine the surface content of the catalysts. XPS revealed different contents of nitrogen gained by using different nitrogen precursors, which were tied to electrochemical activities observed in this work by using the rotating disk electrode (RDE) method. The catalysts revealed high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity even at low loadings and excellent stability over 1000 potential cycles. This indicates their applicability as cathode materials in alkaline anion exchange membrane fuel cells. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nitrogen doped graphene has been synthesized using hydrothermal method and thermal solid state method with ammonia and melamine as nitrogen sources respectively. Platinum nanoparticles have been dispersed over these support materials using polyol method and these Pt loaded nitrogen doped graphene samples have been studied as electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell and for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). Also, the role of multiwalled carbon nanotubes as a spacer which avoids face to face agglomeration of graphene sheets has also been studied for both the samples. The morphology and structure of the graphene based powder samples have been studied using X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Half cell and full cell measurements have been performed on the samples for ORR. and MOR. With the use of functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes, a maximum power density of 704 mW cm(-2) and 650 mW cm(-2) has been obtained with Pt dispersed nitrogen doped graphenes prepared by hydrothermal and thermal solid state methods respectively. The results have been compared with commercial Pt/C catalyst. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, nanoparticles of Pt-Ni alloy were supported on a new kind of composite which composed of graphene sheets and meso-macroporous SiO2, and the composite supported Pt-Ni catalyst was applied to the preferential oxidation of CO (CO-PROX) in H(2)rich gases. The bimetallic Pt-Ni alloy catalyst was characterized by using techniques of SEM, TEM, XRD, TPR, CO chemisorptions and XPS. The catalyst showed excellent catalytic performance for CO-PROX with high activity at low temperature, high selectivity and very good stability, which was attributed to the following characters of the catalyst: Pt -Ni nanoparticles were in alloy state and highly dispersed, Pt-Ni nanoparticles were preferentially loaded on the surface of graphene sheets, and the meso-macroporosity of the composite markedly improved the mass transferring ability. This is a case study, and this kind of catalysts can be extended to other gas-solid catalytic reactions. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

CP  - 2nd International Symposium on Catalytic Science and Technology in Sustainable Energy and Environment (EECAT)
CL  - Tianjin, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - A series of composites comprised of graphene (rGO) and carbon nanotube (CNT) with various weight ratios of them have been synthesized. The catalytic performance of the Pt catalysts supported on the rGO CNT composites has been evaluated in the dehydrogenation of liquid organic hydride (decalin) for hydrogen releasing and compared with that of Pt/rGO and Pt/CNT catalysts. Both microwave irradiation and conventional heating methods have been adopted for the reaction. The structural and surficial features of the composites and rGO as well as CNT have been characterized by means of several techniques. The thermal behaviour of different carbon materials under microwave irradiation has been measured. The results show that there is an optimal CNT weight content in the composites leading the Pt/rGO-CNT0.17 catalyst to the best performance that cannot be achieved by the other catalysts including Pt/rGO and Pt/CNT as well. This has been ascribed to the most plentiful interface formed between rGO and CNT of a proper content, which is beneficial to the deposition of the Pt nanoparticles having the highest catalytic activity. Additionally, the strong coupling effect of carbon materials with microwave irradiation gives rise to better catalytic performance in comparison to conventional heating due to its capability to induce higher reaction temperatures. Nevertheless, the intrinsic catalytic properties of the Pt catalysts supported on different carbon materials are independent on the heating modes. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Hydrogen generation by hydrolysis of alkaline sodium borohydride using a cobalt-zinc-boron/graphene nanocomposite treated with sodium hydroxide
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A Co-Zn-B/graphene nanocomposite was prepared by in situ reduction of cobalt and zinc salts on the surface of graphene (GP), and its catalytic performance in hydrogen generation (HG) by hydrolysis of NaBH4 was investigated. This composite exhibited excellent catalytic properties and great promise for real-world applications in HG and hydrogen storage. Characterization using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) adsorption analysis showed Co-Zn-B nanoparticles attached to the GP surface. The catalytic activity was further improved by treating the nanocomposite with NaOH to remove zinc from the composite matrix and increase the active surface area. The BET measurements showed the specific area of the treated material increasing from 86.4 to 120.2 m(2)/g. The effects of temperature, NaBH4 concentration, and NaOH concentration on HG were investigated. The measured HG rate was 2180 mL/(min.g) at 30 degrees C in a 5 wt.% NaOH + 3 wt.% NaBH4 solution, much higher than rates obtained for unsupported Co-Zn-B catalysts. The stability of the fabricated composite catalyst was also explored. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Superior high-rate capability of hierarchically structured flower-like magnetite-carbon-graphene composite for Li-ion anode
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A nano/micro hierarchical composite structure is prepared by solvothermal synthesis from iron alkoxide in an inert atmosphere. It consists of graphene sheet and flower-like Fe3O4 particle covered by carbon coating (designated as Fe3O4@C). The synthesized composite is an excellent anode for Li-ion batteries. This is attributed to its double structure of current collector. High reversible lithium storage capacity (1439 mA h/g at 0.2 C after 47 cycles) and superior high-rate capability (619 mA h/g at 5 C) are examples of this property. The carbon coating of the Fe3O4@C is in direct contact with the Fe3O4 particles to form local conductive connections, Fe3O4@C tightly covering graphene sheets can be employed as the current collector as well as bridge connection of the Fe3O4@C particles. Therefore, the double structure of current collector can form superior-conductivity networks, providing an efficient electron transport between active materials and Cu current collectors. This double structure prevents the break down of electric connection between the active material and the current collector during protracted cycles of charge and discharge.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Defect-rich MoS2 nanosheets are vertically grown on graphene-protected Ni foam by a facial hydrothermal route. The vertically aligned MoS2 nanosheets with defects such as cracks, amorphousness and oxygen-incorporated disorders endow these as-synthesized catalysts with rich active sites, high conductivity and good stability. The graphene deposited on Ni foam increases its stability in acid. The optimized catalyst exhibits high activity for hydrogen evolution with a quite low overpotential of 140 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 42 mV decade(-1), and a large exchange current density of 63 mu k/cm(2), as well as excellent stability. This performance is superior to most of its analogue MoS2 and many transition metal sulfides. This work will broaden the vision to improve the activity of self-supported electrocatalysts by carefully designing the anchored catalysts. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Poly[2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl phosphorylcholine]-Stabilized graphene-iron oxide composites for water splitting
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The electrolysis of water is considered as a potentially realistic technology for the massive production of hydrogen. The use of graphene composites in electrocatalytic water splitting has been extensively investigated. Graphene-iron oxide composites were prepared via in situ polymerization of 2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) and poly (ethylene glycol) monomethacrylate (PEG) on graphene surface (non-oxidative graphite-HOPG/G) in presence of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) and denoted as G-INSCP. Co-polymers PMPC-co-PEG (CP) and block copolymer PMPC-b-PEG (BCP) were prepared and their structures were thoroughly characterized. These polymers were used to prepare G-INSCP, G-CP, and G-BCP, their stabilities were compared and their morphologies were studied. HOPG, G-CP, and G-INSCP were used in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as effective platinum catalyst alternatives. G-BCP composite was excluded owing to its very low stability. To evaluate the performance of these electrocatalysts in acidic media, linear sweep voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were employed. Results revealed that, compared with HOPG and G-CP, G-INSCP exhibited a significantly improved catalytic activity with respect to HER in an acidic electrolyte. Additionally, at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), G-INSCP demonstrated a lower overpotential and Tafel slope of 95 mVRHE and 67 mV dec(-1), respectively. These observations were attributed to the synergistic effect between the magnetic IONPs and PMPC polymer along with the increase in the electron transfer rate owing to the conductive graphene in the catalyst. Thus G-INSCP catalyst can be a potential candidate for HER and paving the way for the advancement of new and similar catalysts for other applications. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB  - A three-dimensional Li4Ti5O12/carbon nanotubes/graphene composite (LTO-CNT-G) was prepared by ball-milling method, followed by microwave heating. The as-prepared LTO-CNT-G composite as anode material in lithium-ion battery exhibited superior rate capability and cycle performance under relative high current density compared with that of Li4Ti5O12/CNTs (LTO-CNT) and Li4Ti5O12/graphene (LTO-G) composites. Graphene nano sheets and CNTs were used to construct 3D conducting networks, leading to faster electron transfer and lower resistance during the lithium ion reversible reaction, which significantly enhanced the electrochemical activity of LTO-CNT-G composite. The synergistic effect of graphene and CNTs can greatly improve the rate capability and cycling stability of Li4Ti5O12-based anodes. The LTO-CNT-G composite exhibited a high initial discharge capacity of 172 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and 132 mAh g(-1) at 20 C, as well as an excellent cycling stability. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrated that the LTO-CNT-G composite has the smallest charge-transfer resistance compared with the LTO-CNT and LTO-G composites, indicating that the fast electron transfer from the electrolyte to the LTO-CNT-G active materials during the lithium ion intercalation/deintercalation owing to the three-dimensional networks of graphene and CNTs.

TI  - Photocatalytic properties of two-dimensional graphene and layered transition-metal dichalcogenides based photocatalyst for photoelectrochemical hydrogen generation: An overview
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Hydrogen production through photoelectrochemical (PEC) water-splitting process has drawn significant research attention because it is a promising clean source of energy for improving earth climate in the future. Two-dimensional (2D) graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), as the core of the system, have become versatile materials for the development of photocatalyst due to their distinct optical, electrical, thermal and mechanical properties. TMDCs have received significant consideration because of low-cost and earth-abundant catalysts that can replace noble metals, such as Pt. Therefore, comprehensive discussions on the structure and properties of 2D graphene and layered TMDCs materials are presented. We also gather and review various fabrication methods for TMDCs based and graphene-TMDCs-based photocatalysts that can affect the PEC performance and hydrogen evolution. The inherent limitations and several future trends on 2D graphene and layered TMDCs-based photocatalyst for PEC water-splitting application are also discussed.

TI  - Green fabrication of graphene quantum dots from cotton with CaSiO3 nanostructure and enhanced photocatalytic performance for water treatment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Perovskite nanostructures have become one of the most alluring classes of materials because of their structure and properties, which have revolutionized many areas of electronics, optoelectronics, and photonics. In this research, CaSiO3 nanostructures have been prepared by hydrothermal synthesis as profitable and light-active materials for photocatalytic activities. The photocatalytic procedure is an eco-friendly method, which is recognized as an effective alternative for the degradation of multiple hazardous materials. In this regard, photocatalytic properties of oxide perovskite have been developed by effective incorporation of CaSiO3 nanostructures with graphene quantum dots (GQDs) under facile green low-cost hydrothermal conditions. The impact of two factors, including diverse varieties of surfactants and concentration of GQDs, was surveyed through XRD, FESEM images, and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) on purity, structure, and photocatalytic performance. The results demonstrated that the CaSiO3/GQDs in high-level concentration showed higher visible-light photocatalytic activity. Besides, the kinetics of photocatalytic reactions was investigated, and the outcomes showed that higher photocatalytic performance possessed a higher reaction rate coefficient.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the polymer/MWCNT nanocomposites were synthesized from the pristine MWCNT and polymer binders using functionalization with solution processing methods. The synthesized polymer/MWCNT nanocomposites exhibited high specific surface areas than the pristine MWCNT. The MWCNT/Nafion nanocomposite attributed to the maximum peak current at 5.795 x 10(-5) (A) while the peak current of MWCNT/PBI was obtained at 3.662 x 10(-5) (A). Moreover, polymer/MWCNT based electrocatalysts performed better electrochemical activity because of polymers binders can assist electrochemical interaction using the high surface areas of the catalyst supporting material. Also, the MEAs fabricated using the hot pressing method, while the acid doped PBI membrane sandwiched between the electrodes. The fabricated MEAs were successfully demonstrated in a single cell and found capable of measuring a maximum power density of 112.10 mW/cm(2) under 150 degrees C temperature. In conclusion, the synthesized catalyst-supporting materials enhanced the electrochemical activity and catalyst stability which fulfilling the main objective of this study.

TI  - Facile in-situ electrochemical fabrication of highly efficient nickel hydroxide-iron hydroxide/graphene hybrid for oxygen evolution reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is an essential process in energy conversion and storage, especially in water electrolysis, while developing active and low-cost catalysts is the key to maximizing O-2 production. Here a facile three-electrode electrolysis system is firstly applied to synthesize nickel hydroxide-iron hydroxide/graphene hybrid. To fully utilize the electrical energy and simplify the catalyst synthesis, we made graphite exfoliated into graphene at the cathode and nickel-iron hydroxide synthesized at the anode simultaneously. The best electrocatalytic performance of Ni-Fe/G for OER shows an overpotential of 280 mV (without iR compensation) at 10 mA cm(-2), superior to commercial RuO2 (341 mV). Results show that the introduction of Fe in Ni-Fe/G not only converts part of alpha-Ni(OH)(2) into more active beta-Ni(OH)(2), but promotes the electric conductivity and electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the obtained Ni-Fe/G, therefore Ni-Fe/G shows the superior OER performance. The OER activity of Ni-Fe/G can be further adjusted by experiment conditions including electrolysis time and electrolyte concentration. This work provides a novel and facile method for highly efficient OER via engineering the non-noble metal hydroxide/graphene hybrid.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) reinforced with polystyrene sulfonic acid functionalized micelle templated mesoporous MCM-41 for direct methanol fuel cells
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A composite membrane comprising sulfonated polyether ether ketone (sPEEK) and polystyrene sulfonic acid functionalized micelle templated MCM-41 (PSSA-f-MCM-41) is realized as a potential alternative to the Nafion membrane for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC). PSSA-f-MCM41 incorporation in sPEEK leads to improvement in the physio-chemical properties such as ionic conductivity, methanol permeability, tensile strength, water uptake and ion exchange capacity. The methanol permeability of the composite membrane i.e. PSSA-f-MCM-41 (1.5 wt %)-sPEEK is reduced by 60% in comparison to pristine sPEEK. Moreover, the electrochemical selectivity of the aforesaid composite membrane is four times higher than sPEEK. The DMFC performance shows the peak power density of 147 mW cm-2 for the composite membrane which is higher than the pristine sPEEK and Nafion 117 membranes. Stability test for the composite membranes confirm less degradation in OCV in comparison to pristine sPEEK. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) derived Mo2C@sulfur-doped carbon aerogels for hydrogen evolution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 8th International Conference on Hydrogen Production (ICH2P)
CL  - Brisbane, AUSTRALIA
AB  - Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), is considered as an ideal alternative approachs to settle the energy crisis. Therefore, we need to explore efficient and stable non-Pt-based electrocatalysts for hydrogen production from water electrolysis. In this work, S-doped ultra fine molybdenum carbide anchored on cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) derived carbon composite aerogels (Mo2C@S-CA) were synthesized for HER by a simple one-step carbonization method, utilizing inorganic-organic hybrid ammonium molybdate/CNC (AMM/CNC) as precursor. The obtained Mo2C@S-CA aerogels can not only provide plenty of active sites, but also accelerate the hydrogen release from the reaction surface of the electrocatalysts. The as-synthesized catalysts exhibit superior HER activity with a small overpotential value of 176 mV vs. RHE at 10 mA cm(-2) and excellent long-term stability after 10,000 cycles in 0.5 M H2SO4. These superb properties make the catalyst be a promising electrocatalyst for the HER. This work highlights the importance of biomass-derived multifunctional value-added composite aerogels in enhancing the electrolysis of water. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Influence of alkaline 2D carbon nitride nanosheets as fillers for anchoring HPW and improving conductivity of SPEEK nanocomposite membranes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, novel composite membranes were prepared based on sulfonated poly (ether ether ketone)/phosphotungstic acid/carbon nitride nanosheets (SPEEK/HPW/g-C3N4). The alkaline ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets in the membranes behaved like "double-sided adhesive", forming hydrogen bonds with the HPW molecules to anchor hydrophilic HPW without leaking. Moreover, the amine groups of nanosheets formed acid base pairs with -SO3H of the SPEEK polymer matrix, facilitating the Grotthuss-type transport of proton to improve conductivity. The g-C3N4 inorganic particles provided tortuous pathways for methanol transport to suppress the methanol permeability coefficient. The selectivity of the SPEEK/HPW/g-C3N4-1.0 was 2.3 times higher than that of SPEEK/HPW and 1.5 times higher than that of pristine SPEEK. SPEEK/HPW/g-C3N4 hybrid membranes exhibited stable and durable operation for 240 h under 100% RH at 60 degrees C. Moreover, membranes exhibited superior mechanical property, with maximum elongation at break of 223.3%. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Co3O4@g-C3N4 supported on N-doped graphene as effective electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a key component of numerous energy conversion equipment, including metal-air batteries and fuel cells. Reasonably designing high efficiency non-noble materials as ORR electrocatalysts is crucial for large-scale practical applications. In this work, a calcination-hydrothermal method is used to prepare Co3O4@g-C3N4 (g-C3N4 wrapped Co3O4 nanoparticle) supported on nitrogen doped graphene (NG). The electrochemical activity of composites is estimated by cyclic voltammograms and linear sweep voltammetry in 0.1 M KOH medium. Owing to the positive synergistic role stemming from the Co3O4, g-C3N4, Co-N-x effective sites and N modified graphene in the composite material, the Co3O4@g-C3N4/NG owns positive onset potential of 0.920 V (vs. RHE) and half-wave potential of 0.846 V (vs. RHE), which are superior to onset potential of 0.917 V and half-wave potential of 0.824 V for commercial Pt/C, respectively. Additionally, it also exhibits longer-term stability and stronger methanol resistance comparing with Pt/C. The nonprecious metal catalyst could be used as a hopeful catalyst to substitute commercial Pt/C for ORR. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Novel bimetallic graphene-cobalt-nickel (G-Co-Ni) nano-ensemble electrocatalyst for enhanced borohydride oxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Electrochemically active bi-metallic nano-ensemble, Graphene-Cobalt-Nickel (G-Co-Ni) is proposed as the electro-catalyst for direct oxidation of BH4- ions. Three nano-hybrid electro-catalysts namely Graphene-Cobalt (G-Co), Graphene-Nickel (G-Ni) and Graphene-Cobalt-Nickel (G-Co-Ni) are synthesized and characterized using XRD, FTIR, Raman's spectroscopy, SEM, HRTEM, EDAX and mass absorption spectroscopy. The electrocatalytic activity of the synthesized catalysts towards the oxidation of BH4- ions was investigated by means of cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). Among the different electro-catalysts G-Co-Ni (similar to 4.5:1:1 weight ratio) exhibits the highest value of electroactive surface area (ESA = 518.6 m(2)/gm). G-Co-Ni shows enhanced mass specific activity (msa: 750-900 A g(-1)) towards the direct oxidation of BH4- ions and oxidation of H-2 generated by catalytic hydrolysis of BH4- ions comparing with G-Ni (msa: 130 -160 A g(-1)) and G-Co (msa: 120-130 A g(-1)) catalysts. The enhanced electro-catalytic activity is attributed to the increased number of reaction sites and pathways of electron transfer through graphene supported bimetals.

TI  - Novel fabrication of PdCu nanostructures decorated on graphene as excellent electrocatalyst toward ethanol oxidation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the electrochemical reduction reaction of copper(II) formate on the graphene/glassy carbon electrode (G/GCE) surface in the HCl (5 wt.%) was employed for fabrication of the Pd-Cu nanostructures by galvanic displacement reaction. This method has a number of advantages including being environmentally-friendly, simplicity, inexpensiveness and fast. The Pd-Cu nanostructures decorated on the G/GCE were fabricated in two steps: (1) electrochemical reduction reaction of copper(II) formate to Cu on the G/GCE and (2) the galvanic replacement reaction between Cu and Pd2+ ions. The physical and electrochemical properties of as-prepared Pd-Cu/G were investigated via Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy, Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy, Cyclic Voltammetry, Chronoamperometry, and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy. The Pd-Cu/G compositional effect on ethanol oxidation in alkaline media is investigated. The results were shown that the catalytic activity and durability of Pd-Cu/G catalyst are superior to those of Pd/C electrocatalyst for ethanol oxidation. The Pd-Cu/G increased the current density 6.2 times more than Pd/C with a 50 my negative shift in onset potential for electrooxidation of ethanol. Besides, the novel Pd-Cu/G catalyst exhibits large electrochemically active surface area, lower apparent activation energy, higher levels of stability, poisoning tolerance, and lower charge transfer resistance compared to the Pd/C for the oxidation of ethanol.

TI  - An improved hybrid nanocomposites of rice husk derived graphene (GRHA)/Zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 for hydrogen adsorption
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, hybrid nanocomposites rice husk derived graphene (GRHA) and zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) were prepared for hydrogen adsorption. The main contribution of this study is the simplification of the synthesized GRHA/ZIF-8 hybrid nanocomposites. Besides that, the use of synthesized graphene from rice husk (RH) could help in overcoming environmental issue since disposal of RH is rather challenging. GRHA was obtained through calcining rice husk ash (RHA) at 900 degrees C for 2 h in a muffle furnace at atmospheric condition while the nanocomposite of GRHA/ZIF-8 was produced in free solvent condition using deionized water at room temperature for only 1 h. The N-2 adsorption-desorption indicated a type I isotherm. Interestingly, it was found that the BET specific surface area (BETSSA) of GRHA/ZIF-8 showed enhancement up to 3 times higher as compared to pristine GRHA with the addition of 0.2 g of GRHA. From the experimental data, the adsorption of H-2 by nanocomposite GRHA/ZIF-8 obeyed the pseudo-second order kinetic model and intraparticle diffusion model with R-2 value up to 0.9890 and 0.8087 respectively at 12 bar. Moreover, the GRHA/ZIF-8 possessed highest hydrogen adsorption of 31.84 mmol/g at 12 bar. These impressive results are justified by the combination of ZIF-8's microporosity and GRHA's mesoporosity.

TI  - Enhanced H-2 evolution and the interfacial electron transfer mechanism of titanate nanotube sensitized with CdS quantum dots and graphene quantum dots
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Synergistic the modulation of photon absorption capability and interfacial charge transfer of the photocatalyst are highly required for developing high-performance heterojunction photocatalysts. The ternary CdS-graphene quantum dots-titanate nanotubes (CdS-GQDs-TNTs) nanocomposite have been prepared by an in situ growth method. The physicochemical characterization reveals that the GQDs are firmly decorated on both inner and outer surface of TNT through the formation of Ti-O-C chemical bonding, and CdS-QDs are loaded on the outer surface of TNTs through strong interfacial interaction. The intimate integrated CdS-GQDs-TNTs nanocomposite exhibits much superior photocatalytic performance toward H-2 production compared with binary GQDs-TNTs and pure TNTs photo catalyst, which can be attributed to the combined interaction of the stronger visible light harvesting, the longer lifetime of photogenerated electron hole pairs, faster interfacial charge transfer rate, fast and long-distance electron transport pass. The interfacial charge transfer mechanism of CdS-GQDs-TNTs ternary composite are proposed based on photo electrochemical measurements. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Optimization of MnO2-Graphene/polythioaniline (MnO2-G/PTA) hybrid nanocomposite for the application of biofuel cell bioanode
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study reports the synthesis of a nanocomposite comprised of graphene (G) supported manganese dioxide (MnO2) incorporated into the network of polythioaniline (MnO2-G/PTA). The hybrid composite was applied as an electrode material for the development of a bioanode. The bioanode was fabricated by the electrochemical entrapment of ferritin (Frt) as mediator and glucose oxidase (GOx) enzyme in the matrix of the as-synthesized MnO2-G/ PTA deposited on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) surface. The structural features and electrochemical behaviour of the modified electrodes were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results unfolded that the hybrid electroactive support (MnO2-G/PTA) employed for the immobilization of the enzyme (GOx) established an appropriate electrical cabling between the redox enzyme (GOx) and the electrode surface with the assistance provided by the biocompatible mediator (Frt) working to enhance the electrical signals. The developed GCE/MnO2-G/PTA/Frt/GOx bioanode attained a maximum current density of 3.68 mAcm(-2) at 35 mM glucose concentration at a scan rate of 100 mVs(-1). Thus, the MnO2-G/PTA/Frt/G0x modified electrode possesses high potential and good biocompatibility for bio-electricity production from glucose. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Insight into effects of graphene and zinc oxide in Li4Ti5O12 as anode materials for Li-ion full-cell battery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Programmable design of nanocomposites of Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) conducted through hydrothermal route in the presence of ethylenediamine as basic and capping agent. In this work, effect of ZnO and Graphene on the Li4Ti5O12 based nanocomposites as anode materials investigated for Li-Ion battery performances. The full cells battery assembled with LTO based nanocomposites on Cu foil as the anode electrode and commercial LMO (LiMn2O4) on aluminum foil as cathode electrode. X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), along with Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images was applied for study the composition and structure of as-prepared samples. The electrochemical lithium storage capacity of prepared nanocomposites was compared with pristine LTO via chronopotentiometry charge-discharge techniques at 1.5-4.0 V and current rate of 100 mA/g. As a result, the electrode which is provided by LTO/TiO2/ZnO and LTO/TiO2/graphene nanocomposites provided 765 and 670 mAh/g discharge capacity compared with pristine LTO/TiO2 (550 mAh/g) after 15 cycles. Based on the obtained results, fabricated nanocomposites can be promising compounds to improve the electrochemical performance of lithium storage. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Magnetically-driven Ag/Fe3O4/graphene ternary nanocomposite as efficient photocatalyst for desulfurization of thiophene under visible-light irradiation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In current research, hierarchical flower-like Ag/Fe3O4/graphene ternary nanocomposites were prepared successfully by a refluxing co-precipitation method. In the synthesis process of the samples, the various reaction conditions such as reflux time and temperature, type of capping agent and reducing agent were investigated. After characterization of the products by XRD, EDS, VSM, FESEM, HRTEM and UV-Vis DRS analysis, the nanocomposites were applied as novel nanophotocatalysts for desulfurization of thiophene under visible light illumination. Results indicate that the porous flower-like Ag/Fe3O4/graphene photocatalyst with appropriate band gap energy (2.73 eV), has excellent photocatalytic desulfurization activity (similar to 95%) after 2 h of visible light irradiation, even after 10 cycles. Furthermore, the reliable photo-oxidation mechanism was explained based on the active species trapping experiments, which exhibited that the oxidative h(+) and O-center dot(2)- species were the dominant active species in the photodesulfurization process. Also, the photocatalyst particles can efficiently separate from the solution by applying a magnetic field. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - In situ grown Co3O4 nanocubes on N-doped graphene as a synergistic hybrid for applications in nickel metal hydride batteries
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of high-power batteries for applications in electric vehicles, power tools, military devices, etc. has attracted great attentions in recent years. Here the synergistic effect between Co3O4 nanocubes and N-doped graphene has been considered to focus on the major obstacle of the sluggish kinetics of carrier transport and electrochemical reaction during charging/discharging. As an example, we have fabricated the Co3O4 nanocubes/Ndoped graphene hybrid material and combined it with hydrogen storage alloys. The asfabricated composite exhibits superior rate performance for applications in nickel metal hydride battery. An ultra-high capacity of 223.1 mAh g(-1) is achieved at a specific current of 3000 mA g(-1), which is 3.2 times that of the commercial alloy electrode (68.7 mAh g(-1)). Such remarkable high-rate dischargeability originates from the unique three-dimensional integrated porous structure of Co3O4/N-doped graphene, which provides: (1) small internal resistances due to the conductive substrate of N-doped graphene; (2) high electrocatalytic activity of Co3O4 nanocubes; (3) a suppression of re-stacking of N-doped graphene nanosheets; and (4) efficient ion and electron pathways and also short transport distances.

TI  - Recent progress on tungsten oxide-based materials for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Review
AB  - As a form of clean and renewable energy, hydrogen has received much attention recently. However, industrial hydrogen production is primarily via conversion of natural gas, which consumes a large amount of energy and emits large volumes of greenhouse gases. Electrochemical water electrolysis is a promising, pollution-free method for the production of hydrogen from water. Efficient, cost-effective, stable and abundant catalysts that can drive hydrogen production in water with minimal electrical bias are a major goal towards achieving electrolysis on a large scale. Recently, tungsten oxide-based materials have emerged as one of the most promising electrocatalytic compounds, due to their activity, low cost and durability in both acid and base conditions. There are often oxygen vacancies in metal oxides, whether intentional or not, which can potentially promote the water electrolysis. In this review, we provide an overview of tungsten oxide-based materials used for electrocatalytic water splitting. In addition, mechanisms to improve the electrocatalytic activities of oxygen vacant tungsten oxide are summarized and discussed, with proposals for future research. This review article will provide a valuable resource for scientists pursuing materials for electrochemical water splitting. (C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Investigation on sulphonated zinc oxide nanorod incorporated sulphonated poly (1,4-phenylene ether ether sulfone) nanocomposite membranes for improved performance of microbial fuel cell
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrothermally prepared zinc oxide nanorods are sulphonated (SeZnO NR) and incorporated into 15% Sulphonated Poly (1,4-Phenylene Ether Ether Sulfone) (SPEES) to improve the hydrophilicity, water uptake and ion transfer capacity. Water uptake and ion transfer capacity increased to 34.6 +/- 0.6% and 2.0 +/- 0.05 meq g(-1) from 29.8 +/- 0.3% and 1.4 +/- 0.04 meq g(-1) by adding 7.5 wt% SeZnO NR to SPEES. Morphological studies show the prepared S eZnO NR is well dispersed in the polymer matrix. SPEES +7.5 wt% SeZnO NR membrane exhibits optimum performance after three-weeks of continual operation in a fabricated microbial fuel cell (MFC) to produce a maximum power density of 142 +/- 1.2 mWm(-2) with a reduced biofilm compared to plain SPEES (59 +/- 0.8 mW m(-2)), unsulphonated filler incorporated SPEES (SPEES + 7.5 wt% ZnO, 68 +/- 1.1 mW m(-2)) and Nafion (130 +/- 1.5 mW m(-2)) thereby suggesting its suitability as a sustainable and improved cation exchange membrane (CEM) for MFCs.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The graphene nanosheets are synthesized by modified Hummer's method, based on which the dual active metals Ni and Al doped graphene composites are prepared through in-suit reaction and self-assembly with high-temperature reduction process. The molecular structure, morphology and specific surface area of graphene nanosheets are characterized systematically. The phase composition, surface morphology and hydrogen storage properties of dual active metals Ni and Al doped graphene composites are further investigated by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and gas reaction controller. Results show that the graphene nanosheets have typical graphene feature, whose transparent graphene edges can be observed clearly, and the specific surface area is as high as 604.2 m(2) g(-1). The Ni and Al doped graphene composites are composed with Ni, Al and C phases, which have high hydrogen storage capacity and excellent hydriding/dehydriding stabilities. The maximum hydrogen storage uptake of such composites is up to 5.7 wt% at 473 K, and the dehydriding efficiency is high as 96%-97% at the dehydriding temperature of 380 K. The hydrogen adsorption and desorption rate control step of the Ni and Al doped graphene composites is complied to the nucleation and two-dimensional growth mechanism.

TI  - Improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution by facet engineering of core-shell structural CdS@ZnO
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The synthesis of photocatalysts with controlled facets has become an important approach to enhance the H-2 evolution activity. However, the relationship between different exposed facets of heterojunctions and photocatalytic performance still needs to be further investigated. In this study, three types of CdS@ZnO core-shell architectures with tunable heteroinnerfaces were fabricated. Hexagonal wurtzite ZnO samples with different percentages of exposed (001) facet showed up as rod-like, short rod-like and disk-like morphologies, respectively, subsequently, self-assembled flower-like CdS coated on the whole facet of ZnO, constructing a core-shell nanostructure with the corresponding tunable heterointerfaces. Under visible-light irradiation, it was discovered that the performance of hydrogen evolution is proportional to the ratio of (001) facet of ZnO in CdS@ZnO core-shell structures. Further photoelectric tests indicated that the (001) facet of ZnO by CdS modification can form a more perfect combination than that of (100) facet of ZnO, which exhibits higher electron conduction and separation performance.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Hydrogen has the highest gravimetric density (energy density per unit mass) of any fuel. The combustion of hydrogen releases energy in the form of heat. When hydrogen reacts with oxygen in a fuel cell, the reaction releases energy in the form of electricity. Unlike hydrocarbon-based fuels, the generation of energy from either the combustion of hydrogen or the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen in a fuel cell is not accompanied by the emission of greenhouse gases. This makes hydrogen a promising solution to solve global warming issues. However, hydrogen has a low volumetric density (low energy density per unit volume) which makes storing or transporting hydrogen extremely difficult and expensive. To accelerate the utilization of hydrogen as an energy carrier, it is necessary to develop advanced hydrogen storage methods that have the potential to have a higher energy density. The hydrogen storage market is segmented by application into: (1) Stationary power: stored hydrogen is consumed for example in a fuel cell for use in backup power stations, refueling stations, power stations; (2) Portable power: hydrogen storage applications for electronic devices such as mobile phones, flash lights, and portable generators; and (3) Transportation: industries including automobiles, aerospace, unmanned aerial systems, and hydrogen tanks used throughout the hydrogen supply chain. The increasing devel-opment of light and heavy fuel cell vehicles is expected to drive the development of on-board solid-state hydrogen technologies. A large number of research groups worldwide for many years have been trying to develop materials having the right set of thermodynamic and kinetic properties, along with all of the physical properties (high gravimetric density, high volumetric density, etc.) to allow for low-pressure storage system in ambient conditions. However, to date, no material has been found that satisfies all the desired properties to be viably used in many appli-cations. Even if we consider only three parameters namely gravimetric density, volumetric density, and system cost, no materials that can meet the ultimate targets of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) or the 2030 targets of the European Union's Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (FCH JU) and the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) in Japan. The present article reviews advances in solid-state hydrogen storage technology and compares the opportunities and challenges of selected materials. The materials reviewed in this article have a wider spectrum than the materials reviewed in other existing articles, including carbon nanotubes (CNTs), metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), graphene, boron nitride (BN), fullerene, silicon, amorphous manganese hydride molecular sieve, and metal hydrides. Pioneering works, important breakthroughs, as well as the latest developments for promising materials are also reviewed. In addition, for the first time the targets set by several official regulatory agencies for solid-state hydrogen storage are summarized. Achievements in academic and industrial research are compared against these targets. The future prospects of promising materials are analyzed based on how its practical application can be implemented according to market needs. (c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Boosting electrocatalytic activity of ultrathin MoSe2/C composites for hydrogen evolution via a surfactant assisted hydrothermal method
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - MoSe2/C nanocomposites have been synthesized through a facile surfactant-assisted hydrothermal method. The as-prepared composites are well characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), atom force microscope (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy. The experimental results manifest that the introduction of sodium dodecyl sulfate brings more abundant active edges for MoSe2 and the glucose provides conductive amorphous carbon materials. Meantime, the steric effect of surfactant and glucose-derived carbon efficiently inhibit MoSe2 layers from stacking to evolve into few-layered structures. As a consequence, the as-prepared MoSe2/C nanocomposites deliver superior electrocatalytic activities towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) originating from their desirable structural features inclusive of limited layers, rich exposed edge sites as well as effective bonding with electroconductive amorphous carbon.

TI  - Preparation of NiMoO4-PANI core-shell nanocomposite for the high-performance all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, the high conductivity nanocomposite of NiMoO4-PANI (polyaniline) is synthesized via chemical polymerization, while NiMoO4 nanorods are prepared with a solvothermal method. Furthermore, based on NiMoO4-PANI nanocomposite, we fabricate supercapacitor electrode, which shows an excellent chemical stability of 80.7% and a good specific capacitance of 1214 F g(-1). In addition, we assemble an all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device, which uses NiMoO4-PANI and activated carbon (AC) as positive electrode and negative electrode, respectively. The ACS device demonstrates 33.07 Wh kg(-1) at 240 W kg(-1), 93 F g(-1) at 0.3 A g(-1) and a high retention value (about 98.6% of original value after 5000 cycles) of capacitance. Finally, two white LEDs can work for 15 min by using the ASC device (finished charging). Thus it can be seen that such unique properties of the binary nanocomposite strongly couple the advantages of the impressively high cyclic stability of NiMoO4 and good electrical conductivity of PANI, respectively, which mainly give credit to synergistic effects of NiMoO4 and PANI.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we introduce a novel ZnTe/quinhydrone (ZnTe/QH) nanocomposite as an excellent catalyst for electro-oxidation of ethanol in alkaline medium. The ZnTe semiconductor nanorods were synthesized by a novel chemical route. The synthesized product was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), FT-IR spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry techniques. Then, this product along with quinhydrone were used for the electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol in alkaline medium. The ZnTe/QH/GCE showed a higher electrocatalytic activity toward ethanol oxidation. The performance of catalyst was evaluated by electrochemical measurements such as cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy using the three-electrode system. Furthermore, the ZnTe/QH/GCE displayed a higher stability with 93% retention of the initial current density after 6000 s in long term current-time curve. This newly prepared ZnTe/QH nanohybrid could be a promising anodic catalyst for the direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs) application. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - A ternary Ag/TiO2/CNT photoanode for efficient photoelectrochemical water splitting under visible light irradiation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A ternary Ag/TiO2/CNT photoanode was prepared by grafting Ag nanoparticles on the surface of as-synthesized TiO2/CNT nanocomposite for the photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting under visible light irradiance. The ternary composite photoanode was observed to generate four times higher photocurrent density compared to binary TiO2/CNT nanocomposite under visible light irradiance. The Ag nanoparticles on the surface of nanocomposite act as a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) photosensitizer under visible light. The enhanced photocurrent density of Ag/TiO2/CNT ternary photoanode is attributed to the increased light absorption in the visible region, decrease in band-bending and effective interfacial electron transfer due to the synergetic effect of Ag nanoparticles and CNTs. The enhanced charge transfer within the Ag/TiO2/CNT was also confirmed by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. This work demonstrates a feasible route to improve the PEC performance of TiO2 towards water splitting under sunlight irradiation. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Facile preparation of nanoporous TiO2/MoOx composite and its high lithium storage performances as an anode material
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nanoporous TiO2/MoOx composite is easily fabricated via one-step mild dealloying of well designed TiMoAl ternary alloy in alkaline solution. Selectively leaching the Al atom from the precursor alloy resulted in the formation of nanoporous TiO2/MoOx composite accompanied with the natural oxidation of Ti and Mo atoms. The TiO2/MoOx composite is comprised of interconnected nanoscaled network backbone and hollow channels with the ligament size around 40 nm and the pore size around 90 nm. Owing to the rich porosity and the incorporation of MoOx, the as-made nanocomposite exhibits markedly enhanced lithium storage performances with superior reversible capacity, outstanding rate capability, and prominent cycling stabilities compared with the pure TiO2. Especially, the reversible capacity remains about 321.6 and 167.5 mA h g(-1) at the rate of 300 and 1000 mA g(-1), respectively, after long cycling up to 500 times. Benefitting from the unique performance and facile preparation, the TiO2/MoOx composite holds promising application potential as an anode material in lithium-ion batteries.

AB  - In the last decade, supercapacitors possessing high power density and cyclic stability have attracted great interests in various applications. Graphene-based composite electrodes are known as a promising candidate for supercapacitors due to synergistic effects. For the first time, in this work, we develop a simple one-step hydrothermal synthesis of graphene wrapped Ni3S2 nanocubes (rGO-Ni3S2) composite for high-performance and low-cost supercapacitor electrodes. The rGO-Ni3S2 electrode exhibits an ultrahigh specific capacity of 616 C g(-1) at the current density of 1 A g(-1) with excellent cycling durability of 92.7% after 5000 cycles, which is much better when compared with the counterpart without graphene (pure Ni3S2). We attribute the remarkable performance of the rGO-Ni3S2 electrode to the synergistic effects of the graphene as the conductive support and Ni3S2 cubics as the pseudocapacitive material. This work constitutes a step forward towards the development of low-cost and high-performance supercapacitors for the next generation of portable electronics.

TI  - Polydopamine-coated halloysite nanotubes supported AgPd nanoalloy: An efficient catalyst for hydrolysis of ammonia borane
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - AgPd alloy nanoparticles (NPs) supported on halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) coated poly-dopamine (PDA) successfully synthesized by one-pot hydrothermal route. XRD, TEM and XPS were employed to verify the alloy structure of the obtained AgPd NPs. The HAADF-STEM result revealed that the thickness of PDA coating was similar to 10 nm, which could be formed on the surface of HNTs, and the existence of PDA was beneficial to deposit AgPd alloys with high dispersibility on the surface of HNTs. AgPd/PDA-HNT nanocomposites were effective catalysts for the hydrolysis of ammonia borane at room temperature, and the reaction was completed within 160 s using Ag3Pd2/PDA-HNT as catalysts, with a high total turnover frequency (TOF) value of 90 mol(H2) mol(catalyst)(-1) min(-1) and a low apparent activation energy (Ea) of 22.7 kJ mol(-1). After the sixth cycle, Ag3Pd2/PDA-HNT catalyst retained 72% of its initial activity and 100% conversion. The excellent catalytic properties, good durability and reusability, enabled Ag3Pd2/PDA-HNT to be an ideal catalyst in the practical applications. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Photoelectrochemical performance of graphene-modified TiO2 photoanodes in the presence of glycerol as a hole scavenger
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Graphene-modified TiO2 (G-TiO2) photoanode films were successfully prepared by a simple, versatile, and low-cost spray pyrolysis deposition method. The effects of graphene incorporation on the relevant properties of TiO2 films were investigated by means of XRD, SEM, UV-vis absorbance spectroscopy, and photoelectrochemistry-related measurements. Bias-dependant efficiency calculated from linear-sweep voltammograms shows that the presence of graphene within the film networks, despite its low content, could promote a substantial improvement in maximum photoconversion efficiency from 0.39% (at -0.27 V vs HgO|Hg) to 0.65% (at -0.35 V vs HgO|Hg). This improvement is attributable to the enhancement of the electron-transferring ability upon the insertion of graphene, as confirmed by transient photocurrent analysis and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). The effectiveness of the photoelectrochemical cell employing G-TiO2 as an excellent photoanode was further examined by running it in the presence of glycerol as a hole scavenger. Glycerol plays an important role as an effective sink for the photogenerated holes so that the surface charge recombination can be significantly suppressed and, subsequently, the photocurrent is enhanced. The additional photocurrent due to glycerol introduction into the cell depends upon the initial concentration of glycerol according to a model resembling a Langmuir-Hinshelwood isotherm. Based upon the results of the present study, further improvements in terms of graphene content, surface morphology modification or the use of other organic wastes as hole scavengers may be important for future investigation.

TI  - Nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dot/graphene hybrid nanocomposite as an efficient catalyst support for the oxygen reduction reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dot/graphene (N-CQD/G) hybrid nanocomposite was synthesized in-situ using a sacrificial template-assisted pyrolysis method with an oligomeric phenolic resin as the carbon source and dicyandiamide as the sacrificial template precursor/nitrogen source. Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, nitrogen adsorption desorption, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were employed to characterize N-CQD/G samples. The Pt nanoparticles were then deposited onto N-CQD/G hybrids (Pt/N-CQD/G) using a polyol reduction method. Structural and morphological investigations for the Pt/N-GQD/G revealed that ultrafine Pt particles with an average size of 2.1 nm, together with CQDs, are uniformly dispersed on the surfaces of graphene nanosheets. Compared with commercial Pt/C catalysts, Pt/N-CQD/G with highly electrochemical active surface area (ca. 123.4 m(2) g(pt)(-1)) show remarkably enhanced electrocatalytic activity and durability toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The superior ORR catalytic performance of Pt/N-CQD/G can be attributed to highly distributed Pt nanoparticles with small size, nitrogen-doping, and strong interaction between metal and support, as well as the unique structure of N-CQD/G hybrids which combines the advantages of both carbon quantum dot and graphene, such as abundant edges and doping sites, high surface area, large pore size and high electrical conductivity.

TI  - Surface and interface properties of monolayer graphene on hydrophobic and hydrophilic ultrananocrystalline diamond structures for hydrogen sensing applications
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Here, for the first time, we synthesize hybrid hydrophilic and hydrophobic nanocarbon materials with reliable and stable gas sensing performance. The hybrid monolayer graphene (Gr)enitrogen and argon (N-2 and Ar) gas incorporated ultra-nanocrystalline diamond (Gr/N-2@UNCD and Gr/Ar@UNCD) structures were synthesized using a microwave plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (MPECVD) method. The presented nanohybrid combinations have a unique morphology with diamond defects (sp(3)) covered by a graphene sheet (sp(2)). Sample sensors with metal electrodes were fabricated to study the H-2 gas sensing properties of the material. Thus, the as-fabricated Gr/N-2@UNCD exhibited higher sensor response (14.6%) than those of the as-fabricated Gr, N-UNCD and Gr/Ar@UNCD (3.6, 1.07 and 11.2%) based devices. The Gr/N-2@UNCD nanohybrid based sensor showed outstanding repeatability, selectivity and stability over similar to 56 days. The substantial improvement in the H-2 sensing performance of the as-fabricated Gr/N-2@UNCD nanohybrid based sensor was attributed to the modifications in surface morphology and resistance. The partial-hydrophobic surface of Gr/N-2@UNCD alters the beneficial resistivity and improved absorption, which assists in the efficient transport of electrons and H-2 gas molecules. The hybrid nanostructure of Gr-N-2@UNCD exhibits several unique properties that paves the way to future opportunities for advanced gas sensor fabrication. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Loading and promoter effects on the performance of nitrogen functionalized graphene nanosheets supported cobalt Fischer-Tropsch synthesis catalysts
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of nitrogen functional groups on graphene surface and also the effects of cobalt loading and ruthenium promoter on the performance of nitrogen functionalized graphene nanosheets (N-GNS) supported cobalt catalysts in Fischer Tropsch synthesis (FTS) are investigated. A 15 wt% Co/PGNS catalyst, a series of Co/N-GNS (15-30 wt% loading) and ruthenium promoted catalysts (25 wt% Co,0.5 wt% Ru/N-GNS and 25 wt% Co,0.5 wt% Ru/PGNS) were prepared by impregnation method. The purified GNS and functionalized GNS and all catalysts were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, FTIR, SEM, EDS, ICP, BET, TEM, XRD and TPR. The catalysts assessed in FTS in a fixed bed micro-reactor at 220 degrees C, 1.8 Mpa and H-2/CO ratio of 2. Functionalization of GNS shifted the TPR reduction peaks to lower temperature, increased the dispersion of cobalt particles and increased the percentage CO conversion from 70.6% to 74.5%. Increasing the cobalt loading resulted in increasing the average cobalt cluster size, improvements in the reducibility of Co3O4. The maximum FTS activity for N-GNS supported catalyst is achieved at 30 wt % cobalt loading. The C-5(+) selectivity for the 30 wt % cobalt catalyst was higher than that of the 15 wt % Cobalt catalyst. Addition of 0.5 wt%Ru increased the FTS rate (gCH/(gcat.h)) from 0.377 to 0.412 and the liquid products selectivity from 86.5% to 91.2%. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB  - Layered graphene/MnO2 composite was successfully synthesized by an electrostatic self-assembly process. First, positively charged colloidal MnO2 nanosheets and negatively charged colloidal graphene nanosheets were uniformly mixed; then graphene nanosheets were assembled on MnO2 nanosheets via electrostatic attraction. The structure and morphology of the obtained material were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results shown the mass ratio of graphene was about 4.4%. The capacitive properties of the samples were characterized by means of cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge discharge (CD), and electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. The specific capacitance of graphene/MnO2 composite was found to be 280 F g(-1) at a current density of 0.2 A g(-1). Remarkably, its specific capacitance sharply increased during the initial 1000 cycles and then slowly increased to its maximum value at about the 3000th cycle, indicating that an electrochemical activation process occurred during the initial thousands of cycles. The mechanism of electrochemical activation is discussed in detail. Additionally, over 96.8% of maximum capacitance was retained after 10,000 cycles, exhibiting its excellent cycle stability. The enhanced specific capacitance and excellent cycle performance of graphene/MnO2 composite compared to pure MnO2 were attributed to the synergic effect of highly specific capacitance of MnO2 and excellent conductivity of graphene. Our experimental results demonstrated that graphene/MnO2 composite is a promising candidate as an electrode material for supercapacitors. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

TI  - Synthesis of Co(OH)(2)/graphene/Ni foam nano-electrodes with excellent pseudocapacitive behavior and high cycling stability for supercapacitors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vertically aligned graphene nanosheets have been synthesized by radio-frequency plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition on nickel-foam current collectors and that have been used as substrates for cathodic electrodeposition of cobalt hydroxide nanosheets in Co(NO3)(2) aqueous solution. Raman spectrum exhibits that high-quality graphene nanosheets have been synthesized. The composites have been characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge. It indicates that hexagonal Co(OH)(2) has a network microstructure, consisting of interlaced sheets with the thickness of 12 nm coated on the graphene nanosheets. The binder-free nano-electrode exhibits excellent pseudocapacitive behavior with pseudocapacitances of 693.8 and 506.2 Fg(-1) at current density of 2 and 32 Ag-1, respectively, in a potential range of -0.1 -0.45 V. The capacitance can retain about 91.9% after 3000 charge-discharge cycles at 40 Ag-1, which is higher than that of Co(OH)(2)/Ni foam (after 2000 cycles, 75.5% of initial capacitance remains). The introduction of graphene between Co(OH)(2) and Ni foam demonstrates an enhancement of electrochemical stability of the nano-electrodes. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

TI  - Electric field induced enhancement of hydrogen storage capacity for Li atom decorated graphene with Stone-Wales defects
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The density functional theory calculations are carried out to investigate the enhancement of the hydrogen storage ability induced by the electric field (E-field) vertical to the surface of the Li atom decorated graphene with Stone-Wales defects. When without E-field, the binding energy (E-b) of the Li atoms to the hollow site of the heptatomic ring is 2.89 eV, which is larger than that at the hollow sites of the hexatomic ring and the pentatomic ring, indicating the Stone-Wales defect on the graphene surface can effectively enhance the binding strength of the Li atom. When the upward +0.01 au E-field is imposed, the Eb of the Li atom on the hollow site of the heptatomic ring increases to 3.41 eV, which is larger than the double of the experimental cohesive energy of bulk Li (1.63 eV), consequently allowing the dispersion of Li atoms without clustering, which is the basis for large amount hydrogen storage. The maximum number of H-2 molecules adsorbed by each Li on the surface of the SW defective graphene under the upward 0.01 au E-field is 5, one more than that without E-field. The average adsorption energies of molecular hydrogen around Li in the presence of upward 0.01 au E-field are in the range of 0.21-0.46 eV, which are larger than that in the field-free case and intermediate between physisorbed and chemisorbed states (0.1-0.6 eV). The SW defective graphene adsorbs hydrogen molecules mainly through the polarization interaction. The calculated desorption temperature and molecular dynamic simulation indicate that the H-2 molecules are easier to be desorbed under the downward E-field. Therefore, the Li decorated graphene with SW defects is appropriate for hydrogen storage under near-ambient conditions with the application of an E-field. Keeping five H-2 molecules adsorbed per Li and stabilizing the dispersion of individual Li atoms under the upward E-field, the structure can serve as better building blocks of polymers. These findings suggest an effective route to control the hydrogen storage abilities of nanomaterials. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Metal-organic frameworks derived spinel NiCo2O4/graphene nanosheets composite as a bi-functional cathode for high energy density LieO(2) battery applications
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Electrode materials having a combined heterostructure morphology can boost the electrochemical performance of energy conversion and storage applications. In this paper, we prepared three-dimensional (3D) porous NiCo2O4 dodecahedron nanosheets (NCO) from a metaleorganic framework template (ZIF-67) and incorporated them with two-dimensional (2D) multilayer graphene nanosheets (GNS) through a simple and rapid ultrasonication process. The combination of these 3D/2D nanostructures created effective interfaces between the NCO and GNS components that enhanced the intrinsic electronic properties and increased the number of active catalytic sites on the NCO@GNS surfaces. Accordingly, the NCO@GNS electrocatalyst displayed superior kinetics for both the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in both aqueous and non-aqueous electrolytes and could be fabricated into an air-cathode for Li-O-2 battery applications. The NCO@GNS air-cathode delivered a specific storage capacity (7201 mA h g(-1)) higher than those of the NCO and commercial carbon black electrodes. We tested the durability of the Li-O-2 battery featuring the NCO@GNS cathode in a new PAT-cell configuration; it exhibited long-term cyclability for 200 cycles with a limited capacity of 500 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 100 mA g(-1). This cathode design featuring meso- and micropores shortened the pathways for Li+ ion diffusion and ensured rapid electron and oxygen transfer, thereby increasing the lifetime of its corresponding Li-O-2 battery.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Graphene was synthesized via electrochemical exfoliation technique of graphite rod in Poly (sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) solution. Laser Raman and X-ray Diffraction Spectroscopies were used to confirm the defects and crystal nature of graphene. The surface wettability studies based on water contact angle, further differentiates the affinity of as prepared graphene and pristine graphite towards water. Modified Glassy carbon (GC) electrodes were prepared by electro-deposition of Platinum (Pt) on bare and graphene coated GC, denoted as GC/Pt and graphene/Pt modified GC respectively. The morphology and chemical composition of the thus synthesized graphene and graphene/Pt modified electrodes were investigated by High resolution transmission electron microscopy, Scanning electron microscopy and Energy dispersive spectroscopy. The electrochemically active surface area of the electro-deposited spherically shaped Pt particles was calculated to be 63.96 m(2) g(-1) and 25.10 m(2) g(-1) on graphene/Pt and GC/Pt, respectively. The electrocatalytic performance of modified electrodes for methanol oxidation was envisaged by cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry and chronoamperometry. Graphene/Pt modified GC electrode showed higher oxidation peak current (42.90 mA cm(-2)) than GC/Pt modified electrode (16.24 mA cm(-2)) in forward scan of methanol oxidation because of the uniform distribution of spherically shaped Pt particles on graphene. The reaction path for methanol oxidation at different potentials was elucidated by means of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB  - Conductive polymer composite (CPC) materials are extensively used for the bipolar plate in Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs). The produced CPC materials through the extrusion process strongly relate to electrical conductivity and mechanical properties. In this study, milled carbon fibre (MCF) reinforced polypropylene (PP) incorporating carbon nanotube (CNT), or graphene nanoplatelets (xGNP) are pre-mixed using the extrusion process to orientate the fibres before undergoing the compression moulding at 13.8 MPa and 200 degrees C for 15 min. The CNT composites exhibited the higher through-plane conductivity of 14.8 S/cm as compared to xGnP composites with 4.9 S/cm at 70 wt% of MCF. The flexural strength improved after being compressed to 99.6 MPa and 172.5 MPa for 70 wt% of CNT and xGNP, respectively. This reveals that the oriented fibres can boost the CPC performance.

TI  - In-situ preparation of cross-linked hybrid anion exchange membrane of quaternized poly (styrene-b-isobutylene-b-styrene) covalently bonded with graphene
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introducing graphene into polymer matrix is an effective way to enhance performances of anion exchange membrane (AEM). However, utilizing the advantages of graphene by physical approach is limited due to the weak interface interaction between graphene and polymer matrix. Herein, we report an effective strategy to covalently bond graphene with polymer matrix to improve the interface interaction and further to improve the properties of AEM. A series of cross-linked quaternized graphene-based hybrid AEM were fabricated by covalently bonding poly (vinylbenzyl chloride) grafted graphene (GN-g-PVBC) copolymer with chloromethyl functionalized poly (styrene-b-isobutylene-bstyrene) (SIBS) through the cross -linker (N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-1,6-hexanediamine) by in -situ synthetic approach. The interface interaction between graphene and QSIBS is greatly enhanced according to micromorphology characterization of the hybrid membrane. The cross -linked quaternized hybrid AEM containing 0.55 wt% of GN-g-PVBC exhibits obviously improved dynamical mechanical properties (storage modulus: 418 MPa), ion conductivity (1.81 x 10(2) S cm(-1)), methanol barrier property (5.19 x 10(-7) cm(2) s(-1)), selectivity (3.49 x 10(4) S s cm(-3)) at 60 degrees C and especially a comparably excellent chemical stability to that of Nafion 115 due to the enhanced interface interaction between graphene and the polymer matrix.(C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB  - In this study, three-dimensional (3D) graphene aerogel (GA) was synthesized by a self-assembly hydrothermal process as a PEM fuel cell catalyst support. The synthesized GA was also modified with the polypyrrole (PPy) by in-situ chemical oxidative polymerization of the pyrrole monomer (PPy-GA). The electrocatalytic performance of the platinum (Pt) nanoparticles (NPs) supported with both GA and PPy-GA materials towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was investigated. In addition, the hydrophobic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymer was added to the catalyst ink media in order to enhance the hydrophobic property and durability of the synthesized GA and PPy-GA supported Pt catalysts. Pt NPs were decorated over the support materials with the microwave irradiation technique. Various characterization techniques such as FTIR, Raman Spectroscopy, BET, SEM, EDX, TEM, TGA, contact angle measurements, 3D topography images and four-point probe electrical conductivity measurements were performed in order to analyze the GA based support materials. Electrochemical characterizations were also carried out with cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. It was observed that PDMS addition to the catalyst ink media increased the electrocatalytic activity and durability of the GA supported Pt catalyst. Otherwise, the performance of the PPy modified GA supported Pt catalyst was negatively affected by the addition of PDMS to the catalyst media. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - MoS2 supported on MOF-derived carbon with core-shell structure as efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, the porous carbon polyhedra were firstly obtained by carbonizing the zeolite imidazole framework (ZIF-8). Then the carbon polyhedra and precursors of MoS2 were successfully combined by a hydrothermal reaction,. forming the C-MoS2 composites with different carbon contents. The well-tuned C-MoS2 sample possesses a core-shell morphology, in which the carbon substrate is well decorated by vertically aligned MoS2 ultrathin nanosheets. The resulting composites can be used as electrocatalysts of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), displaying significantly superior activities to pure MoS2 and carbon. It's found that the carbon content largely affects the architectures and HER behaviors of catalysts. In particular, the optimized catalyst yields the best catalytic activity with the lowest onset potential (35 mV), smallest Tafel slope (53 my dec(-1)), lowest over potential (200 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)), as well as extraordinary long-term stability in H2SO4. The enhanced HER activity can be attributed to the unique core-shell structure, where abundant active edge sites of MoS2 are exposed and the underlying carbon substrate effectively improves the conductivity of the electrode.

TI  - Biomass-derived graphene-based nanocomposite: A facile template for decoration of ultrathin nickel-aluminum layered double hydroxide nanosheets as high-performance supercapacitors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - One promising approach to design of high performance supercapacitors is based on the coupling the conductive porous carbon matrixes and the electroactive components. However, the main challenge to this goal is the maintaining the long cycling life, high power and high energy densities of the related capacitors. Herein, we reported on an electroactive composite based on biomass derived 3D graphene coupled with nickelaluminum layer double hydroxides for manufacturing a cathode material in a supercapacitor. The electrode exhibits a remarkable specific capacitance of 1390 F g(-1) at 1 Ag-1, and ultrahigh rate capability of 60% from 1 to 30 Ag-1, as well as excellent cycling stability with a capacitance retention of 92% after 5000 cycles. Furthermore, the electrode was used as the positive electrode against a Vulcan XC-72R as the negative electrode to assemble an asymmetric supercapacitor. The asymmetric supercapacitor device exhibited a maximum energy density of 173 Wh kg(-1) and power density of 28.8 kW kg(-1) as well as excellent cycling stability of 92% after 5000 cycles. The asymmetric supercapacitor could lighted up LED lamps with different colors more than 24 min. The work showed promising performance of further application in electrochemical devices.

TI  - Template assisted hydrothermal synthesis of CoSnO3 hollow microspheres for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The practical complications suffered by the most recognized electrochemical energy systems, such as, water-electrolyzers and metal-air batteries reside in the half-cell oxygen evolution reaction. To resolve this problem, continuous colossal efforts are required to develop the active, affordable and sustainable electrocatalysts. Shape-tailoring of the catalysts, constructed from non-noble metals is one of the emerging strategies to augment the activity of the material toward electrochemical reactions. In the present work, we demonstrate the template-assisted hydrothermal synthesis of hierarchical CoSnO3 hollow microspheres, constructible from the wafer-thin sheets of CoSnO3. The hierarchical CoSnO3 hollow microspheres possess a high specific surface area of 153.59 m(2)/g, and mesoporous configuration, which are the essential pre-requisites of an electrochemical system. In addition to this, the proposed CoSnO3 hollow microspheres possess adequate electroactive surface area (793.5 cm(2)) and happens to be a suitable candidate for driving the oxygen evolution reaction with a low overpotential of 282 my and Tafel slope of 96.5 mV/dec in alkaline medium. The higher turnover frequency (0.0045 s(-1)), high specific and mass activities (2.195 mA/cm(EASA)(2) and 28.752 mA/mg, respectively) were observed for CoSnO3 hollow spheres. Furthermore, the chronoamperometric measurement reveals a good stability of CoSnO3 hollow microspheres in alkaline condition, satisfying the fundamental demand of an energy system.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, manganese tungstate (MnWO4) microflowers as electrode materials for high performance supercapacitor applications are prepared by a one-pot sonochemical synthesis. The crystalline structure and morphology of MnWO4 microflowers are characterized through X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy. The electrochemical properties of the MnWO4 microflowers are investigated using cyclic voltammograms, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The MnWO4 microflowers as electrode materials possess a maximum specific capacitance of 324 F g(-1) at 1 mA cm(-2) in the potential window from 0 to +1 V and an excellent cycling stability of 93% after 8000 cycles at a current density of 3 mA cm(-2). An asymmetric supercapacitor device is fabricated using the MnWO4 and iron oxide (Fe3O4)/multi-wall carbon nanotube as the positive and negative electrode materials, it can be cycled reversibly at a potential window at 1.8 V. The fabricated ASC device can deliver a high energy density of 34 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 500 W kg(-1) with cycling stability of 84% capacitance retained after 3000 cycles. The above results demonstrate that MnWO4 microflowers can be used as promising high capacity electrode materials in neutral electrolyte for high performance supercapacitors.

TI  - Vanadium diboride as an efficient cocatalyst coupled with CdS for enhanced visible light photocatalytic H-2 evolution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploiting active, stable, and cost-efficient cocatalysts is crucial to enhance the photocatalytic performance of semiconductor-based photocatalysts for H-2 evolution from water splitting. Herein, we report on using vanadium diboride (VB2) as an efficient cocatalyst to enhance the photocatalytic H-2 evolution performance of CdS nanoparticles under visible light irradiation (lambda >= 420 nm). The CdS/VB2 composites prepared by a facile solution-mixing method exhibit much improved H-2 evolution activities in 10 vol% lactic acid (LA) solution relative to pristine CdS. The most efficient CdS/VB2 composite with 20 wt% VB2 (CB20) exhibits a H-2 evolution rate as high as 12.1 mmol h(-1) g(-1), which is about 11 times higher than that of CdS alone (1.1 mmol h(-1 )g(-1)). Moreover, the highest apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 4.4% is recorded on CB20 at 420 nm. The improved photocatalytic activity of CdS/VB2 composite can be attributed to the excellent cocatalytic effect of VB2, which can not only enhance the charge separation on CdS but also accelerate the H-2 evolution kinetics. This work demonstrates the great potential of using transition metal brodies (TMBs) as efficient cocatalysts for developing noble-metal-free and stable photocatalysts for solar photocatalytic H-2 evolution.

TI  - Heteroatom-doped carbon nanospheres derived from cuttlefish ink: A bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction and evolution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of efficient bifunctional catalysts for both oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions is highly desirable but challenging in energy conversion and storage systems. Here, a simple yet cost-effective strategy is developed to produce heteroatom-doped carbon nanospheres using natural cuttlefish ink as the precursor. For the oxygen reduction reaction, the catalyst exhibits more positive onset-potential and larger diffusion limiting current density compared with benchmark platinum catalyst in alkaline medium. Moreover, the as synthesized catalyst shows low onset-potential for oxygen evolution reaction, indicating its outstanding catalytic activity. The catalyst shows a potential gap of 0.75 V between the oxygen evolution reaction potential at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and the oxygen reduction reaction potential at the half-wave potential, outperforming most of other noble metal-free carbon catalysts in the current state of research. The remarkable catalytic performance can be assigned to heteroatoms doping, full exposure of the active sites, large surface area and enrichment of pores for sufficient contact and rapid transportation of the reactants. This study offers a new approach for the synthesis of metal-free carbon nanomaterials from natural resources, and broadens the design for the fabrication of bifunctional oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution catalysts.

TI  - A noble silver nanoflower on nitrogen doped carbon nanotube for enhanced oxygen reduction reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - An electrodeposition-approach for the synthesis of silver nanoflowers (AgNFs) on nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media has been developed. The as prepared material (NCNTs-AgNFs) has been characterized by various instrumental methods. The morphological analysis shows the unique rose-like AgNFs are placed onto the NCNTs with better dispersion. The higher population of AgNFs has also been observed onto NCNTs coated glassy carbon (GC) rather than bare GC plate. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows chemical reduction and N-doping has done successfully with the restoring sp(2) domain in carbon network. The electrocatalytic activities have been verified using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and hydrodynamic voltammetry techniques in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. The resulting catalyst system, NCNT-AgNFs, surpasses the performance of Pt/C, in terms of a kinetic current density, better fuel selectivity and durability. It is also noteworthy that the NCNT-AgNFs exhibits a four electron reduction pathway for ORR with lowering H2O2 yield. The admirable performance of NCNT-AgNFs catalyst along with higher durability holds great potential for application in various fuel cells as cathode catalyst.

TI  - Non-noble metal ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets modified Mn0.2Cd0.8S heterostructures for efficient photocatalytic H-2 evolution with visible light irradiation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A series of non-noble metal ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets modified Mn0.2Cd0.8S hetero-structured composites were prepared by an ultrasonic assisted hydrothermal synthesis process. Comparing with the pristine Mn0.2Cd0.8S composite, the obtained ultrathin MoS2/Mn0.2Cd0.8S composites exhibited a significantly improved photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution from water with visible light response. The optimized photocatalytic activity toward MoS2/Mn0.2Cd0.8S composite is around 8 times of the pristine Mn0.2Cd0.8S composite. Moreover, the ultrathin MoS2/Mn0.2Cd0.8S composites displayed good photocatalytic stability in the course of photochemical reaction. The excellent photocatalytic activity of the ultrathin MoS2/Mn0.2Cd0.8S composites might be attributed to the formed heterojunctions in composites itself and the sufficient active edge sites in MoS2 phase. A possible photocatalytic mechanism was tentatively proposed. Considering its excellent photocatalytic activity and good photochemical stability, the obtained ultrathin MoS2/Mn0.2Cd0.8S composite has potential application in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water by using solar energy.

TI  - Taming transition metals on N-doped CNTs by a one-pot method for efficient oxygen reduction reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Various transition metals have been incorporated into nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (M-N-C/CNT, M = Fe, Co, Mn, and Ni) via a one-pot method using dopamine as nitrogen source and metal salts as precursors for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Raman spectra and XRD patterns of the catalysts were collected to characterize the graphitization degree and metal state. XPS was employed to determine atom state and element fraction. The electrochemical performance of the catalysts for ORR were evaluated in alkaline media at -0.8 V to 0.2 V. The E-onset and E-1/2 with the values of -100 mV and -170 mV (vs Ag/AgCl) are achieved on Mn-N-C/CNT-800. The superior selectivity toward the 4e(-) pathway are obtained on Mn-N-C/CNT-800 and Co-N-C/CNT-800 with the transferred electron numbers per O-2 molecule of 4.12 and 3.94, respectively. Results show that the states of doped transition metal play a key role on determining ORR performance. The electron transfer number of Ni-N-C/CNT at -0.5 V is increased from 3.22 (Ni-N-C/CNT-800) to 3.99 (Ni-N-C/CNT-600) when the metallic Ni has been eliminated at lower pyrolysis temperature.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY

CP  - 11th International Symposium on Advances in Electrochemical Science and Technology (ISAEST)
CL  - Chennai, INDIA
AB  - In this work, a facile development of a bi-functional electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is reported. A composite material comprising of tiny particles of nitrogen doped graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs) embedded into cobalt oxide (Co3O4) flakes is prepared by sodium borohydride reduction method and followed by annealing at 600 degrees C under inert atmosphere. Structutal, morphological and crystalline featured are analyzed using FESEM, TEM, HRTEM, XRD and XPS studied. More-over, optical and fluorescence properties of N-GQDs are studied using UV-visible and fluorescence spectroscopic techniques. These studies clearly reveal and confirm the formation of a composite material. Further electrochemical characteristics toward OER and ORR are investigated by using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) techniques. Compared to the individual entities of pure Co3O4 and N-GQDs alone, the electrocatalytic activity of N-GQDs/Co3O4 composite material is significantly higher towards ORR. Similarly, the same composite material is also used as an electrocatalyst for OER in 0.1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte and it exhibits a lower overpotential of 330 mV to obtain a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) along with higher electrocatalytic activity and the reason is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect between N-GQDs and Co3O4. Thus, NGQDs/Co3O4 composite material is demonstrated to be a high performance bi-functional electrocatalyst for ORR and OER. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - An easy and eco-friendly method to fabricate three-dimensional Pd-M (Cu, Ni) nanonetwork structure decorated on the graphene nanosheet with boosted ethanol electrooxidation activity in alkaline medium
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A new rapid and facile strategy for the preparation of Pd-Ni/G and Pd-CuJG catalysts with a three-dimensional porous structure are presented in this paper. Both catalysts are formed using the same strategies in two steps: 1) The reduction of Ni(OH)(2) and Cu(OH)(2) to the metallic form on the surface of G/GC Electrode using the Zn/HCl reducer, 2) The galvanic displacement of Ni and Cu by Pd2+. Afterwards, three-dimensional Pd nanonetwork is generated on the glassy carbon electrode via the galvanic displacement. Compared to the other routes, this strategy depicts several advantages (e.g. fast way, facile, surfactant and reductant free, cheap, and eco-friendly.) Both catalysts are applied towards Ethanol Oxidation Reaction (EOR). Both porous structures show higher electrocatalytic activity and stability toward EOR compared to the commercial Pd/C. The extraordinary catalytic activity and durability of the both proposed catalysts for EOR can be related to the two vital reasons:1) The combination of Ni and Cu with Pd will efficiently promote the catalytic performance of Pd-Ni/G and Pd-Cu/G samples due to synergetic effects. 2) The porous structure of the as-prepared catalysts renders a high surface area and leads easier mass transport through the pores.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A class of urchin-shaped nanocomposites composed of MoS2 and Cd0.8Zn0.2S nanoparticles were fabricated in this study, yielding the highest hydrogen evolution rate of 1401 mu mol/g/h when they are applied as the photocatalysts of water splitting reaction. The greatly enhanced photocatalytic activity could last over 24 h. Such great improvement in the photocatalytic activity, which is nearly 11 times higher than that of pure CdS and 9 times of Cd0.7Zn0.3S, and 1.7 times of MoS2 CdS, may be attributed to that the one-step synthetic procedure resulted in tighter interfacial contact of the urchin-like MoS2-Cd0.8Zn0.2S composites. Specifically, solvothermal reaction of molybdenum(V) dimethyldithiocarbamate, diethyldithiocarbamato cadmium(II) and zinc di(benzimidazol-2-yl) disulphide took place simultaneously in one-pot. Characterizations with X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) etc. illustrate that a class of novel urchin-shaped nanocomposite composed of MoS2 and Cd0.8Zn0.2S nanoparticles were formed in this one-pot synthesis. This study therefore presents a simple and effective route to prepare chalcogenide-based photocatalysts for more efficient production of hydrogen from water.

AB  - The inorganic silica immobilized PWA based (Si-PWA)-PVA/PTFE composite membrane was developed by an amalgamation of pore filling and layer by layer (LBL) casting. The composition of the top layer was optimized to be 0.3 M PWA: 0.2 M TEOS: 0.15PVA concerning to proton-conductivity and methanol permeability of the membrane. Surface morphological studies and elemental analysis were carried out by using SEM-EDX. The FT-IR and XRD analysis had confirmed the intercalation of sol with PTFE. Thermal deformation of the membrane was studied by TGA and it is stable up to 180 degrees C. Ion exchange capacity and water uptake were determined to be 2.38 meq per gram and 21.7%. The membrane has exhibited maximum proton conductivity of 41.2 mS cm(-1) at 100 degrees C. The membrane has significantly lower methanol permeability of 3.2 x 10(-7) cm(2) S-1 compared to that of Nafion117 (7.9 x 10(-7) cm(2) S-1) at 28 degrees C and the same trend was observed at 40, 60, and 80 degrees C. The (Si-PWA)-PVA/PTFE composite membrane is showed enhanced proton conductivity and lower methanol permeability at elevated temperatures. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - An ideal visible nanocomposite (Fe/GTiP) photoanode catalyst for treatment of antibiotics in water and simultaneous electricity generation in the photocatalytic fuel cell
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The photocatalytic fuel cell (PFC) has been studied for the wastewater treatment and electricity generation by degrading antibiotic organic pollutant berberine chloride (BC). Through a simple chemical process Fe/GTiP anode and ZnIn2S4 cathode catalysts were prepared and loaded them on carbon fiber cloth. Up to 79% BC (10 mg/L) was removed with simultaneous electricity generation of 0.65 V within 90 min under pH-7 in PFC by using visible light (two 50-W halogen lamps). PFC is better with 79% BC removal and electricity generation than only 79% removal in photocatalysis (PC) without generating any clean energy. Under photocatalysis Fe/GTiP can remove 70% of BC, higher than 54% with GTiP and 12% with TiP at 50 mg catalyst/50 mL (10 mg/L BC). The photocatalytic performance of Fe/GTiP was also compared with commercial P25 and pure TiO2. The obtained removal of 17.4% and 13.25% BC (10 mg/L) with P25 and TiO2 proves that with more visible light absorption Fe/GTiP has significant photocatalytic effect than P25 and pure TiO2. The impacts of external resistance, concentration of catalyst, pH, and electrolyte were investigated in the PFC. Removal of tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) (10 mg/L) followed the same trend as BC under photocatalysis with Fe/GTiP, GTiP and TiP (78%, 60% and 33% at pH-7). The removal of 89% TC (30 mg/L) in 90 min was also achieved with Fe/GTiP. The experimental study shows that Fe/GTiP visible light nanocomposite is ideal for removing antibiotics in water by photocatalysis or with simultaneous electricity generation through PFC.

TI  - Promising nature-based nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanomaterial derived from borassus flabellifer male inflorescence as superior metal-free electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this present study, novel hierarchical nitrogen-doped porous carbon for use as a metal-free oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalyst is derived from borassus flabellifer male inflorescences by calcining at 1000 degrees C in an inert atmosphere using metal hydroxides as activating agent and melamine as nitrogen doping agent. The BET surface areas of the lithium-ion (Li-ion), potassium-ion (K-ion) and calcium-ion (Ca-ion) activated carbon are observed to be 824.02, 810.88 and 602.88 m(2) g(-1) respectively. Another interesting fact is that the total surface energy calculated by wicking method (73.2 mJ/m(2)), is found to be higher for Li-ion activated carbons. Among the prepared nitrogen-doped porous carbon, Li-ion activated system, showed an outstanding performance in ORR reaction in alkaline medium, thanks to its high surface area and notable surface activity. An incontrovertible of note that ORR half-wave potential of Li-ion activated nitrogen-doped carbon (0.90 V) is relatively higher in comparison to the commercial 20 wt % Pt/C catalyst (0.86 V). Inspite of overwhelming performance, the ORR reaction followed the preferred 4- electron transfer mechanism involving in the direct reduction pathway in all activated carbons. The ORR performance is also noticeably better and comparable to the best results in the literature based on biomass derived carbon catalysts. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Non-precious co-catalysts boost the performance of TiO2 hierarchical hollow mesoporous spheres in solar fuel cells
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A main challenge hindering the development of efficient solar fuel cell systems is the identification of robust, cost-effective, and abundant catalysts. Herein, we demonstrate the ability to synthesize photoactive, relatively cheap and abundant catalyst for the solar-assisted water splitting. The proposed catalyst is a composite of Co-Cu/graphene immobilized on hierarchical hollow mesoporous Titania. Diffuse Reflectance analysis showed visible light absorption for (Co-Cu) (2%)-TiO2/RGO with an estimated band gap of 2.41 eV, as compared to 3.13 eV for Titania. Photoluminescence spectra showed a significant decreasing in recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pair for (Co-Cu) (2%)-TiO2/RGO nanocomposites. Upon their use as photoanodes in solar fuel cells, the fabricated nanocomposites show 14-fold increase in photocurrent density compared to Titania. This enhancement was confirmed via the measurement of electron and phonon life times. The results attained in this study demonstrate a step toward using non-precious co-catalysts to boost the performance of photocatalysts in solar fuel cells. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

CP  - International Conference on Sustainable Environment and Energy (ICSEE)

AB  - The effective separation of photogenerated charge carriers, their transport and interfacial contact is of great significance for excellent performance of semiconductor based photo catalysts. Herein, we report the fabrication of two dimensional (2D) nanosheets heterojunction comprising of N-doped ZnO nanosheets loaded over graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets for enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The prepared 2D-2D heterojunctions with varying amount of g-C3N4 nanosheets have been characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. The optimized heterojunction photocatalyst with 30 wt% of g-C3N4 nanosheets (NZCN30) exhibit hydrogen evolution rate of 18836 mu mol h(-1) g(cat)(-1) in presence of Na2S and Na2SO3 as sacrificial agents under simulated solar light irradiation. The enhanced photocatalytic performance of NZCN30 heterojunction has been supported well by photoluminescence and photo electrochemical investigations, which shows the minimum recombination rate and high photoinduced current density, respectively. In addition, the existence of 2D-2D interfacial contact plays a major role in enhanced H-2 evolution by high face-to-face contact surface area for separation of photogenerated charge carriers in space which facilitate their transfer for H-2 generation. This work paves way for the development of 2D-2D heterojunctions for diverse applications. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Phosphorylated chitosan/poly(vinyl alcohol) based proton exchange membranes modified with propylammonium nitrate ionic liquid and silica filler for fuel cell applications
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In our previous work, phosphorylated chitosan was modified through polymer blending with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) polymer to produce N-methylene phosphonic chitosan/ poly(vinyl alcohol) (NMPC/PVA) composite membranes. The aim of this work is to further investigate the effects of a propylammonium nitrate (PAN) ionic liquid and/or silicon dioxide (SiO2) filler on the morphology and physical properties of NMPC/PVA composite membranes. The temperature-dependent ionic conductivity of the composite membranes with various ionic liquid and filler compositions was studied by varying the loading of PAN ionic liquid and SiO2-PAN filler in the range of 5-20 wt%. As the loading of PAN ionic liquid increased in the NMPC/PVA membrane matrix, the ionic conductivity value also increased with the highest value of 0.53 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) at 25 ? and increased to 1.54 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) at 100 ? with 20 wt% PAN. The NMPC/PVA-PAN (20 wt%) composite membrane also exhibited the highest water uptake and ion exchange capacity, with values of 60.5% and 0.60 mequiv g(-1) %) composite membrane displayed a maximum power density, which was increased by approximately 14% compared to the NMPC/PVA composite membrane with 5 wt% SiO2- , respectively. In addition, in the single-cell performance test, the NMPC/PVA-PAN (20 wtPAN. This work demonstrated that modified NMPC/PVA composite membranes with ionic liquid PAN and/or SiO2 filler showed enhanced performance compared with unmodified NMPC/PVA composite membranes for proton exchange membrane fuel cells.

TI  - Phase controlled synthesis and the phase dependent photo-and electrocatalysis of CdS@CoMo2S4/MoS2 catalyst for HER
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Herein we report a heterostructure with ultrathin nanosheets of Co-doped molybdenum sulfide on CdS nanorod array (donated as CdS@CoMo2S4/MoS2) by hydrothermal synthesis. Firstly, elemental Co doping MoS2 (CoMo2S4) delivers the double benefits of increased active sites and enhanced conductivity. Secondly, the structural characteristics maximally exposes the MoS2 edges and enlarges interfacial contact area between the composite catalyst and electrolyte, as well as the efficient interfacial charge transfer. The ratio of CoMo2S4/MoS2 in CdS@CoMo2S4/MoS2 plays a crucial role for the enhanced photo-assistant electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We can tune the ratio of CoMo2S4/MoS2 by controlling the preparation time or the ratio of precursor of Co/Mo. The catalyst with predominant MoS2 phase shows superior photocatalytic HER performance with a high H-2 production rate of 46.60 mu mol mg(-1) h(-1). Meanwhile, the catalyst with predominant CoMo2S4 phase exhibits not only relatively low overpotential of 172 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which outperforms most values that have been reported on catalyst supported on ITO substrate, but also possesses H-2 production rate of 23.47 mu mol mg(-1) h(-1). The superior photo-assistant electrocatalytic HER activity results from the synergistically structural and electronic modulations, as well as the proper energy band alignment between MoS2 and CdS. This investigation could provide an approach to integrate the electro- and photo catalytic activities for HER, especially the photo responding behaviour at a bias potential which is meaningful to produce H-2 for actual application.

TI  - Reconnoitring the nature of interaction and effect of electric field on Pd/Pt/Ni decorated 5-8-5/55-77 defected graphene sheet for hydrogen storage
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - There is plenty of graphene based Hydrogen storage technologies and studies still few questions like 'what kind of interaction present between Metal-Metal, Metal-Graphene, Metal-Hydrogen and Graphene-Metal and a possible way of controlling it to enhance H-2 adsorption' are not revealed properly. Similarly, the chosen metal atoms Pd, Pt and Ni are widely reported as a promising catalyst yet there is no conclusive evidence to show the best among three atoms. Thus, in this present work 5-8-5 and 55-77 defected graphene is decorated with the Pd, Pt and Ni metal atoms to adsorb Hydrogen molecules. The obtained results have shown that the better adsorption of H-2 molecule depends on Metal-Metal and Metal-Graphene interaction. Similarly, the adhesive force between Pt and 5-8-5/55-77 sheets are slightly higher than the Pd and Ni atoms. Pd-Pd (-0.47 eV) and Pt-Pt (-1.99 eV) interaction values on the surface of 5-8-5 sheets are slightly lesser in magnitude than the Pd-C (-1.14 eV, -1.19 eV) and Pt-C (-2.42 eV, -2.55 eV) interactions. The topological analysis results exhibit the partially covalent nature of interaction and it confirms that the adhesive force between Metal-Graphene is higher than the cohesive force between Metal Metal on 5-8-5 and 55-77 sheets. The electrophilicity results of Pd, Pt and Ni decorated sheets show that the two Pt decorated 5-8-5 sheet has higher electrophilicity value of 16.782 eV which is considerably higher than other sheets and this particular 5-8-5-Pt-2 system has higher H-2 adsorption energy value of -1.696 eV. The overall pattern of H-2 adsorption on chosen three metals are Pt > Ni > Pd and our results show that both strong Metal-Metal and Metal-Graphene interactions lead to poor adsorption activity. The metals are strongly polarizing the H-2 molecules which lead to good adsorption. Further, the results confirm that the pi orbitals of Metal and Graphene play a major role in the adsorption of excessive H-2 molecules. In order to enhance and control the H-2 adsorption energy, a positive electric field is applied to the system. This applied electric field enhances the polarization which leads to H-H bond elongation and strong adsorption. From the obtained results, it is conclusive that the 5-8-5-Pt system has shown good response for the supplied electric field with the maximum adsorption energy value of -5.23 eV. Comparatively, the 5-8-5 systems are responding well for the applied electric field by increasing the adsorption energy than 55-77 systems. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction on sulfur-deficient MoS2 nanostructures
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is a 2D layered structured material with a Mo:S of 1:2 and is a great attention seeker for hydrogen production through water-splitting. In the present work, we prepared nanostructured MoSx with different sulfur molar concentrations (x = 2, 1, 0.5) through a one-step hydrothermal method. The decrease in sulfur concentration resulted in a new phase that is MoO3 with a Mo:S of 1:0.5. The structural, morphological, and optical properties of all the samples were studied through X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, respectively. Moreover, the electrochemical behavior was studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), and Tafel slope. Optimum properties were observed for Mo:S (1:1) with an onset potential of 96 mV, an overpotential of 130 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) coupled with a specific capacitance of 889 F/g and low charge transfer resistance of 43 U. Further, it was noted that the electrocatalytic activity of MoS1 was better than that of the composite and bare MoO3. It is proposed that the excellent electrochemical activity arises from sulfur vacancies which provide active sites for HER and a free path for ions to flow through the material.

TI  - The effective methanol-blocking and proton conductivity membranes based on sulfonated poly (ether ether ketone ketone) and polyorganosilicon with functional groups
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To solve the conflict between high proton conductivity and low methanol crossover of pristine sulfonated aromatic polymer membranes, the polyorganosilicon doped sulfonated poly (ether ether ketone ketone) (SPEEKK) composite membranes were prepared by introducing polyorganosilicon additive with various functional groups into SPEEKK in this study. Scanning electron microcopy (SEM) images showed the obtained membranes were compact. No apparent agglomerations, cracks and pinholes were observed in the SEM images of composite membranes. The good compatibility between polymer and additive led to the interconnection, thus producing new materials with great characteristics and enhanced performance. Besides, the dual crosslinked structure could be formed in composite membranes through the condensation of silanols and the strong interaction between matrix and additive. The formation of dual crosslinked structure optimized the water absorption, enhanced the hydrolytic stability and oxidative stability of membranes. Especially, the incorporation of additive improved the strength and flexibility of composite membranes at the same time, meaning that the life of the composite membranes might be extended during the fuel cell operation. Meanwhile, the proton conductivity improved with increasing additive content due to the loading of more available acidic groups. It is noteworthy that at 25% additive loading, the proton conductivity reached a maximum value of 5.4 x 10(-2) S cm(-1) at 25 degrees C, which exceeded the corresponding value of Nafion@ 117 (5.0 x 10(-2) S cm(-1)) under same experimental conditions. The composite membrane with 20 wt% additive was found to produce the highest selectivity (1.22 x 10(5) S cm(-3)) with proton conductivity of 4.70 x 10(-2) S cm(-3) and methanol diffusion coefficient of 3.85 x 10(-2) cm(2) s(-1), suggesting its best potential as proton exchange membrane for direct methanol fuel cell application. The main novelty of our work is providing a feasible and environment-friendly way to prepare the self-made polyorganosilicon with various functional groups and introducing it into SPEEKK to fabricate the dual crosslinked membranes. This design produces new materials with outstanding performance. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Investigation of the versatility of SPES membranes customized with sulfonated molybdenum disulfide nanosheets for DMFC applications
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sulfonated poly(ether sulfone) (SPES) based proton exchange membranes (PEMs) are fabricated using sulfonated molybdenum disulfide (S-MoS2) nanosheets via facile solution casting method. SPES (DS = 30%) and S-MoS2 are synthesized and sulfonation is evidently observed in FTIR and XRD analysis. The anchoring of sulfonic acid group on exfoliated molybdenum disulfide (E-MoS2) and elemental composition of S-MoS2 are confirmed by XPS spectrum. Physico-chemical characteristics such as ion-exchange capacity (IEC), water uptake, swelling ratio and oxidation stability are found to be increases after the addition of S-MoS2 into SPES matrix. Increment in S-MoS2 content in SPES matrix decreases the surface contact angle due to the increase in hydrophilicity. Further, the dispersing ability of SMoS2 in SPES matrix is evidently shown by an increase in surface roughness, tensile strength and thermal stability of the SPES/S-MoS2 nanocomposite membranes. On the whole, SPES/S-MoS2-1 membrane showed the highest proton conductivity of 5.98 x 10(-3) Scm(-1), selectivity of 19.6 x 10(4) Scm(-3)s, peak power density of 28.28 mWcm(-2) and lesser methanol permeability of 3.05 x 10(-8) cm(2)s(-1). The strong interfacial interaction between SPES and S-MoS2 in nanocomposite membranes create strong hydrogen bond network to facilitate the proton conduction pathway We both vehicle and Grotthuss type mechanisms. Overall results suggested that the SPES/S-MoS2 nanocomposite membranes are superior and appropriate alternative for commercially high-cost Nafion (R) membranes for use in renewable direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) devices.
